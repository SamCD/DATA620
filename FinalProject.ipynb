With no Akira in site and 'live music' that fell through for unknown reasons I can only assume that this 'event' was a money-grab intended to draw high rollers to The Bellagio or an attention-seeker for an outdated property hoping to generate new fans; both goals a miserable failure as we walked out in search of sustenance down the strip at Aria.\n",

Epic fail, can't think of a reason to return.  I will use my birthday coupon at another Big Y Group restaurant next year.\n",

Crowd was all sorts including families with kids, couples, large groups, and party goers eating before the day clubs. Service was spotty, but when served was nice. Relative to Bacchanal, the selection is limited. The stars were the AYCE bone marrow and the Ox-****TAIL**** Pho. Other than those two, everything else was mediocre. Bone marrow was savory, fatty, and simply decadent. I made my own sauce concoction that consisted of horseradish, onion, and cilantro, and it made an already yummy dish even better. The Ox-****TAIL**** Pho was one of the best pho soups I've had in my lifetime. The ox-tail broth brought an enhanced beef flavor and the accompanying basil, jalapenos, green onions, and raw sprouts calmed the broth back to what you would expect from pho. \n",

      "This is a small cute little restaurant across the street from CSN. We arrived on a Saturday night at 7:30 PM and it was completely empty! It's sad to see a good restaurant struggling for clients. So apparently they have two menus - tapas and full course items. I'm kind of against tapas these days, but I felt like I had to try some of their signature dishes. We ordered the seared Yellow ****TAIL**** Salad. Unfortunately the Yellow tail was not as fresh as I would like it. This dish comes with a small salad. I enjoyed the apple dressing a lot. We also ordered the Sea Bass with spicy vegetable. This dish was just ok. The fish was fresh, but it was nothing extraordinary. My favorite items were the 10 hour Pork Belly and the Beef Tataki. These are for sure a must try. Overall, the restaurant has a nice atmosphere, and some items were very good. However, the problem with most tapas places is that you have to order and order to keep full as the sizes do not do any justice.\n",

It was a very good cocktail with great flavors and nothing too overpowering. I could have had another, but the first drink took so long I didn't want to wait for another.\n",

Small and humble, a true 'old-world' donut shop with bad coffee and all the classics but none of the fuss, it was no real surprise that on my arrival a typical scene appeared; old men shooting the breeze, smiling clerks occasionally weighing in, and a slow but constant trickle of patrons gathering pink boxes of still-warm pastries to go - mine containing a hefty half dozen.  Modest in my expectations even amidst the historical praise my tasting of Ronald's work began with a tangy and delicate buttermilk bar and progressing through options both yeasted and cake including an impressive tiger tail and seemingly half pound bear claw chalk-a-block full of apples it was not until I reached the greasy and overly processed tasting 'apple burrito' that Ronald's would stumble, a theme also notable in the sizable but otherwise underwhelming apple fritter - an item made far better at Friendly, Coco, and Pinkbox.\n",

The chicken with vodka sauce was delicious. The sauce was perfectly seasoned and the chicken was tender. I did get the famous dessert \"Buddy V Lobster ****TAIL****\". It was a croissant style pastry shaped like a lobster tail filled with cream. It looked really fun, but the pastry was so hard I couldn't cut it with a fork. Other than the dessert everything else was great!\n",

      "I introduced my son, Ben, to Joe's while he was here for an adult-league soccer tournament, and we and Diane all came away from the 2-hour experience happy diners.  In the distant past, I found the Florida Stone Crab Claws to not be that tasty or worth the work of searching through torn shells to scoop out the meat.  But we were in a stone-crab place, so introducing my son to stone crab claws seemed appropriate.  To make sure that we would have a pleasing appetizer course, I hedged by also ordering a Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail, which I knew would be good.  This time the stone crab meat was an eye-opening experience.  I opted for the large claw variety, one for each of us, and wished I had ordered more as my son and I delighted in the sweet, fresh taste of our crab meat, while Diane did not.  I sampled her claw meat, which was light brown in color and not very tasty, while mine was snow white and delicious.  So, I now know that Stone Crab claws can vary in taste.  And, one is not enough.  But at over $13 a large claw, this is not for those with a low dining out budget!  The Shrimp Cocktail was fine and meaty, as expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "A bowl of Crab Bisque was up next.  Very good with bits of crunchy garnish, but warm rather than hot.  I appreciated the pitted Black Olives in Joe's Chopped Salad, and liked the Feta Cheese-laced creation, but missed the prosciutto, pancetta, or ham commonly found in Chopped Salads served in Italian restaurants, which I realize Joe's is not.  So, next time I will revert to ordering a Caesar Salad here.  \n",

      "With all of the Surf & Turf combinations I had recently enjoyed on a cruise around South Africa and during the December holidays just past, I took an unusual detour, and swiveled instead to Chopped Steak for my entree, which is prime grade beef, ordered medium.  I should have ordered it medium-rare, because it arrived medium-well.  Yet showered with a carafe of brown au jus, the meaty dish was still quite tasty.  My son loved his Dover Sole, which was deboned tableside (but for 1 small bone), slathered with Buerre Blanc, and an absolutely huge double-sided fish fillet.  And Diane greatly enjoyed her medium-rare filet dipped in Bearnaise Sauce and 10 oz. Lobster ****TAIL**** dunked in Drawn Butter.  Our server thought that we had ordered enough potato already before I added French Fries to orders of Crispy Hash Brown Potatoes and a Baked Sweet Potato adorned with of all things (Wait for this!) sweet and memorable Praline Pecan Butter.  But crispy Fries just go too well with Chopped Steak to forego.  And, after my son enjoyed a Caesar Salad, we rounded out these sides with tasty Roasted Cauliflower graced by Sage Brown Butter, and a dish of impeccably prepared Sauteed Spinach.  The huge order of slightly crunchy Hash Browns was superior in every sense, and the skin-on Fries fresh and a perfect mate to my Chopped Steak.  The delectable Baked Sweet Potato was just a delightful bonus!  \n",

Once the technical error was corrected, reward points were quickly awarded and a $20 future dining credit appeared.\n",

I am a big fan of the Ronin and Miyagisan Burgers and no matter which location I have had them they are always the treat I expect them to be.   \n",
      "   I usually end up at Bachi Burger due to friends being in town and hearing about this Vegas treat form Triple D or from Yahoo's beat burgers in the US by state.  I am never upset when asked to meet up at Bachi's.  My friends quickly become jealous of the fact I can have Bachi anytime I want.  \n",
      "   The service at this location was better then the other 2.  The Summerlin being the worst of the 3 due to servers being overwhelmed.  The Burger was exceptional and unlike any other Burger I have had.  Unique and delicious.  The Ox ****TAIL**** fries were a treat as always and one order was shared by 3 of us.  it was plenty and we were glad we only ordered one.  \n",
      "   Their prices are on the high side but considering the quality and the uniqueness of their burgers it is well worth splurging on.  I am looking forward to another visit soon :)\n",

      "Thank goodness I was raised in a pretty traditional Chinese family, because even at a young age I tried and fell in love with all kinds of seafoods.  Thus, my expectations for what Rio calls \"the only seafood buffet in Vegas\" is for it to be a spectacular and intense party in my mouth.  Did Rio meet my expectations?  Hell yeah... but it does miss its mark by just a bit.  (3.5 stars for this buffet)\n",
      "\n",
      "This joint is one of two buffets at the Rio, and is arguably the more famous one.  When my sexy lady friends (including Angela Y. and Tiffany D.) told me about it, I was expecting it to be only seafood inside, but luckily there's more to it.  For $40 and a fifteen minute wait before seating, you get a large variety of foods that will be sure to hit any taste buds.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the right side of the buffet, there are a lot of hot foods including pastas and even Chinese food (such as dim sum).  In the center masterpiece, you get all of the seafood options you'd expect from a Vegas buffet (grilled, steamed, fried, and of course- raw) along with prime rib.  Finally on the very left side, there is a large dessert area to end your meal on the sweeter side.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tiffany D. and I became eating buddies, so we tackled the seafood first, and here were some hi-lights and low points:\n",
      "\n",
      "[Cold Options]\n",
      "1. Alaskan King Crab Legs - Decent... they were a bit small in my opinion, and took a long time for the workers to refill them afterward.\n",
      "2. Sashimi - Tuna was rubbery!  Blech... the only decent option was salmon, and it's hard to get that one wrong.\n",
      "3. Oysters - I piled all of these on my plate all at once.  They were a bit small for me, but weren't bad at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Hot Options]\n",
      "1. Fried Calamari - Not bad at all!  Although  the pieces of squid seemed a bit small for me, I was enjoying these small bites.\n",
      "2. Lobster ****TAIL**** in Sauce - I'll admit that none of the other buffets have this option.  The lobster tails were very flavorful and not too strong, however, there wasn't enough to go around during the evening.\n",
      "3. Baked Salmon - Good flavors all around.  The herbs that cooked with it gave it an extra kick.\n",
      "\n",
      "After plates of seafood and a slice of prime rib, it was time to dive into desserts.  The gelato here was incredible!  I haven't had much in my life, but these topped it.  The strawberry and coconut flavors were epic, and I remember tasting them again later in the evening after I had burped.  A must try!\n",
      "\n",
      "So for the food I can give it a solid 4 stars (with a few exceptions), however, the service our night was horrendous!  Our waiter was terrible- we had to call him out after he passed us multiple times for our drink orders (non-alcoholic), and I swore that our plates of crab shells were uncomfortably piling up!  I've served before, and can understand when it is busy you can get caught up, but we felt extremely neglected the whole night there, even when it was not busy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Rio is definitely a must try, but my favorite Vegas buffet awards still go to The Wynn or the Buffet at the M Resort (off the strip).  Parking at the Rio was tough that evening, so be prepared to hunt down a parking space if you come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mountain:4\n",
      "I was told before coming to Vegas to book early and not a buffet on Christmas Day.  Which was great advice because many of the good buffets in Vegas had people in line waiting for four hours or more on Christmas.  So prior to coming I made reservations through yelp for Gordon Ramsey Steak inside Paris Hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "I arrived about 15 minutes before my reservation for 6:45pm.  We weren't seated till 7:00pm but I let it slide due to the fact it was Christmas.  In front there is about five or six tall brunettes that seat guests. As they direct guests to their tables,  guests walk thru the tunnel into the Steakhouse and one of the brunettes will say \"You have been transported from Paris to London\".  Then she proceeds to take you to your table.  \n",
      "Great, I'm in London. (Music is thumping) Is London always this loud?  Don't take mom here for Mother's Day... Ambiance is more for a younger party crowd.\n",
      "\n",
      "The server came promptly with an iPad to order drinks.  The water and drinks come very quick.  The service is what you'd expect from a fine dining restaurant.  Here's what we ordered:\n",
      "\n",
      "Shellfish Platter $75: this came out on a three tier platter.  It had Tiger Prawns, King Crab, Lobster ****TAIL****, Clams, and Oysters.  Everything was fresh and delicious.  There were about four dipping sauces to choose from.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Mac & Cheese $12:  every famous chef, steakhouse, soul food restaurant, etc have their own version of this dish.  Gordon Ramsey has a good version.  Not the best but good nonetheless.  Interesting to me while in Vegas is that Mac & Cheese is close to $20 at many places.  But Gordon keeps it reasonable with his prices all around for the most part.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beef Wellington $52:  tender is the first word that comes to mind.  It's a nice amount of medium rare meat roasted in the pastry.  I'd give it 4 stars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bone-in Ribeye $58:  this was the best part of our meal.  Tender, delicious, juicy 24 once steak.  I know the Beef Wellington is Gordon's specialty and its difficult to make yadda yadda, but the ribeye out shines the Wellington.  It's the Beyonce out shining the rest of Destinys Child.  Boootylicious.\n",
      "\n",
      "One bad note is the restroom looks like I really was transported to a London Pub Restroom, dirty and yuck.  Just hold it till you get back to your suite.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Total bill was around $216. It's pricey but less than many of the other steakhouses in Vegas.  Excellent service, good food, and worth trying.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mountain:4\n",
      "This was my 2nd visit in the past three months and I can say with confidence that on both occasions, it was Excellent.  This place is at least 4.5 stars.\n",

      "\n",
      "After seeing so many pictures of the \"Tar Tar Yellow ****TAIL****\" ($6.95) we had to get this. And this was definitely one of our favorite dishes. Rice, avocado, tomato, lettuce, and chopped yellow tail layered between fried  biscuits. SO unique!!! Nice summer dish!\n",
      "\n",
      "Another item off thier special menu, we got the \"Eel, Kakiage, Tempura Roll\" ($6.95). This was a california roll (avocado, crab, cucumber) topped with tempura, sashimi, and eel. There was NO way you can get this all in one bite so we ended up taking it apart to eat. Very good! The sweet sauce on the eel went nicely with the creamy avocado of the california roll.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next we 1/2 an order of the \"Tom Yum Roll\" ($6.95). This had tempura shrimp, avocado inside and another piece of cooked shrimp and cilantro was placed on top of the roll. Then this combination was wrapped in a spring roll wrap. Honestly? Nothing special. and not really worth $7 for 4 pieces. But a nice light taste especially after squeezing the lime juice on top.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, after seeing so many yelpers post a picture of this Honey Toast ($7.95) dessert, I had to have it! The thing is HUGE. It is literally half a loaf of bread. NO JOKE. Topped with a scoop and vanilla ice cream and drizzled with honey. I would say 80% of the people here got the dessert. And to my surprise the bread is so light and fluffy that we almost killed this thing between the2 of us! crazy!!! The toast is REALLY soft in the inside and toasted on the outside. A simple and light dessert! A must try here!\n",

      "Viet Noodle Bar is an all-around good choice for Vietnamese food in Vegas, but there are dishes here that I absolutely love! \n",
      "\n",
      "The Bánh Xèo (Vietnamese Crêpe) was the first dish to catch my attention at VNB. The dish isn't overly complicated, but super tasty. The crêpe is cooked with onions, shrimp, and pork and folded over in half. There is a jungle of veg accompanying the crepe that includes a stuffing of bean sprouts, a side of pickled carrot & radish, some lettuce leafs, Tía Tô (Perilla), Lá Qu (Thai Basil), and fresh sliced cucumber. You decide how much herbs and veggies to wrap-up with some of the crêpe in a leaf of lettuce, then dip it into the sweet fish sauce and enjoy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've enjoyed all the Phos and soups that I've had at VNB, but I return to the Chicken Pho more than others. I like to limit the amount of red meat I eat so I'm not usually opting for traditional Pho, but it is excellent here as well, as is the Ox ****TAIL**** Pho. Chicken is typically more hit and miss at Vietnamese spots though--often an afterthought lacking flavor or loaded with msg. While certainly not eliminating the msg, VNB does a great job of not relying on it for the main source of flavoring and are still able to develop a substantially flavorful broth in their Chicken Pho.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of my least favorite things about Viet Noodle Bar is the popularity of the on-table BBQ grills. It seems to be a good value for the amount of meat you are supplied with...probably why they are popular...but the result is a restaurant that often reeks of grilled meat. This is not always the smell you want to be wearing for the remainder of your day...so dine with caution. I haven't even ordered any of the grilled entrees, but swear that at least half the time I've carried this smell with me until freed by a shower. \n",

      "I introduced my son, Ben, to Joe's while he was here for an adult-league soccer tournament, and we and Diane all came away from the 2-hour experience happy diners.  In the distant past, I found the Florida Stone Crab Claws to not be that tasty or worth the work of searching through torn shells to scoop out the meat.  But we were in a stone-crab place, so introducing my son to stone crab claws seemed appropriate.  To make sure that we would have a pleasing appetizer course, I hedged by also ordering a Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail, which I knew would be good.  This time the stone crab meat was an eye-opening experience.  I opted for the large claw variety, one for each of us, and wished I had ordered more as my son and I delighted in the sweet, fresh taste of our crab meat, while Diane did not.  I sampled her claw meat, which was light brown in color and not very tasty, while mine was snow white and delicious.  So, I now know that Stone Crab claws can vary in taste.  And, one is not enough.  But at over $13 a large claw, this is not for those with a low dining out budget!  The Shrimp Cocktail was fine and meaty, as expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "A bowl of Crab Bisque was up next.  Very good with bits of crunchy garnish, but warm rather than hot.  I appreciated the pitted Black Olives in Joe's Chopped Salad, and liked the Feta Cheese-laced creation, but missed the prosciutto, pancetta, or ham commonly found in Chopped Salads served in Italian restaurants, which I realize Joe's is not.  So, next time I will revert to ordering a Caesar Salad here.  \n",
      "\n",
      "With all of the Surf & Turf combinations I had recently enjoyed on a cruise around South Africa and during the December holidays just past, I took an unusual detour, and swiveled instead to Chopped Steak for my entree, which is prime grade beef, ordered medium.  I should have ordered it medium-rare, because it arrived medium-well.  Yet showered with a carafe of brown au jus, the meaty dish was still quite tasty.  My son loved his Dover Sole, which was deboned tableside (but for 1 small bone), slathered with Buerre Blanc, and an absolutely huge double-sided fish fillet.  And Diane greatly enjoyed her medium-rare filet dipped in Bearnaise Sauce and 10 oz. Lobster ****TAIL**** dunked in Drawn Butter.  Our server thought that we had ordered enough potato already before I added French Fries to orders of Crispy Hash Brown Potatoes and a Baked Sweet Potato adorned with of all things (Wait for this!) sweet and memorable Praline Pecan Butter.  But crispy Fries just go too well with Chopped Steak to forego.  And, after my son enjoyed a Caesar Salad, we rounded out these sides with tasty Roasted Cauliflower graced by Sage Brown Butter, and a dish of impeccably prepared Sauteed Spinach.  The huge order of slightly crunchy Hash Browns was superior in every sense, and the skin-on Fries fresh and a perfect mate to my Chopped Steak.  The delectable Baked Sweet Potato was just a delightful bonus!  \n",

      "After almost breaking the bank and the calorie count for a table of three, it made no sense not to order dessert.  So our trio split a large slice of Chocolate Fudge Pie topped by clearly homemade Whipped Cream.  Decadent and delicious, and enough for three to share!\n",

      "Service by our head waiter and his assistant, formally clad in the customary Chi-Town black tux style, was impeccable, and our head waiter very patiently helped me add the Lettuce Entertain You app to my mobile phone, and noticed that my email address was not initially accepted because an undesired space lurked between letters.

      "3) Vietnamese Beef Carpaccio: I love me some raw meat, of course the best I've ever had was in France- but who's asking. Lol. This particular Carpaccio wasn't that great. I would give it a hard 3 Stars, that's it. Idk what it is but the sauces on the meat seemed to have cooked it a bit so it wasn't as raw as I prefer. I love me some truffle oil, but it gave a weird taste. Would I order this again? Probably not. It's not a true Carpaccio dish, in my opinion -also for the price it's not worth it.\n",

      "The girlfriend and I went for dinner and drinks at Herbs & Rye on our last night in Vegas upon the recommendation of many of the local bartenders we had encountered during our stay.  It's been our experience that the word of a local bartender especially in Vegas is one to be trusted and this was no exception.  Herbs & Rye is off the Strip and definitely not a stop for most tourists.  It occupies a fairly non-descript block building on W. Sahara, well marked with signage announcing its presence.  Stepping inside is like stepping into a time machine to an Italian steakhouse 30-40 years ago.  I liked it for its laid-back charm and unpretentiousness.  Still, we weren't there to appreciate the architectural and interior design.  We came to eat and drink...not necessarily in that order.\n",

      "We started off with some cocktails and apps.  Herbs & Rye's cocktail list reads like the comprehensive history of American cocktails.  Even if you're not having drinks, the cocktail list is worth a read if only for educational purposes.   I had the classic Lion's ****TAIL**** ($9) made with bourbon, lime juice, pimento dram, simple syrup, and Angostura bitters.  It was a well-made, tasty drink notable for the allspice notes from the pimento dram.  We shared an order of the fried calamari ($15).  It was nicely fried leaving the calamari tender (as fried calamari can be).  It was a bit overpriced by $3-4 considering the portion size received.\n",
      "\n",
      "For my dinner, I had the New York Strip with a side of Truffle Mac & Cheese ($34).  It wasn't a dry-aged prime cut of beef nor was it wagyu, but my steak was cooked to my requested medium rare, juicy and tender enough.  The Truffle Mac & Cheese was cheesy and imbued with plenty of truffle flavor.  In fact, it was to the point of straddling the line of too much truffle essence, as it was the dominant flavor practically overwhelming the cheese.  Service was plus.  Josh, our server, was personable and attentive throughout our meal.\n",

      "From its generic exterior to its dated circa 1960s/70s interior, Herbs & Rye's anti-Strip look and feel belies its true nature.  Herbs & Rye is a first-rate cocktail joint with its outstanding craft cocktails that are well executed and reasonably priced.  The food is satisfying, if a bit unremarkable, and doesn't shine nearly as bright as the cocktails.  That said, I still left fat, dumb, and happy!  I'll gladly return for drinks the next time I'm in town!  3 stars for the food...4 stars for the drinks.  3.5 stars overall.\n",

I could have ordered 5 plates of it alone and been happy with my meal.  Thankfully being with the group I was with that wasn't allowed to happen and I enjoyed several other items from the menu.\n",
      "\n",
      "For myself I ordered the Chilean sea bass with a dry miso rub, the lobster ceviche, uni nigiri, and scallop sashimi.  The sea bass had a very mild flavor although the dry miso was tasty.  I think grilling sea bass rather than steaming it brings out the buttery flavor that it naturally has much better.  The lobster ceviche was great and I could have had a couple more but I held off so I could enjoy my entire meal.  The uni was good, although I don't think the wait staff would be able to tell you whether the uni is good that day or not if you asked.  I'm sure the people preparing the meals would just opt not to serve the uni if they happen to not be able to get some good stuff in that day.  At least I hope so.  The surprise of the meal was the scallop sashimi. It was presented beautifully in a little hollowed out lime cup.  With a dash of soy and wasabi the flavor was amazing.  I really should have gotten at least one more order.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was also able to try some of the tempura rock shrimp, miso black cod, and the wagyu beef.  All were great but the wagyu beef and miso black cod were crazy delicious and will be must order items the next time I eat at Nobu.\n",
      "\n",
      "For dessert I had the hibiscus sorbet with champagne jelly and rock candy.  The popping of the rock candy (pop rocks) in your mouth with the flavor of the hibiscus sorbet and champagne jelly was more fun than some of the Yelp events I've been to.\n",

      "The oysters were good. Our favorites were the cheesy ones but the spinach-hollandaise oysters were good too - just too much spinach. Most of the food on the entrées was excellent. The fillet was seasoned perfectly, tender and juicy-just what my wife wanted. The lobster tail was huge, accompanied by a vat of butter and some big, tender asparagus. My salmon was cooked just right, with a crispy crust but was still moist and with great Cajun seasoning. The crawfish, scallops and shrimp were all good but the shrimp were small. The decadent sauce over all was rich and creamy. I didn't care for the dirty rice but I think it was due to flavors, not the way it was cooked. Just not my kind of rice dish. \n",

The entire restaurant is decorated really cute, and I loved the family photos. Service was attentive but only by our waiter's helper - our waiter took our order then went missing until time for the check. The assistant was great, he deserved all of the tip but I doubt it ended up that way. \n",
      "\n",
      "Chicken Parmesan was huge, definitely big enough to share. We each got a chicken breast and a large portion of spaghetti so I'm glad we split it. The spaghetti sauce was amazing, I'm still dreaming about it. Noodles were cooked perfectly. Chicken was cooked nicely, no complaints about the meal at all. Our Lobster ****TAIL**** was a little hard though, like it was either over cooked or a few days old. Not flakey in a good way, more like shards of hard bread. And the pastry cream tasted like whipped cream, not what I was expecting for the price. We'll definitely be back but only for the Chicken Parm. Might try a different dessert next time.\n",

      "It retains the clubby darkness of the Venetian Restaurant which used to be here for years. It should be noted that wells ($3?) & some beers are on Happy Hour prices, but the Specialty Cocktails they are so well known for are not. Still: the Lion's ****TAIL**** is epic, spicy, and deep with many right notes hit. (10$)\n",

The wee hours bring out interesting people, for sure. \n",

      "After looking through the menu, the server somehow convinced us to go the \"family-style\" way, which is priced at a minimum of $100 per person but he would have the chefs prepare the top dishes in each course to share: 5 appetizers, 4 pastas, and 5 different cuts of meat.  He also guaranteed that we would not go hungry even though it was 9 guys.  \n",

      "1. Insalata Caprese - amazing caprese salad with thick slices of heirloom tomatoes and a mozarella & cream combo called burrata.\n",
      "2. Grilled Octopus - freaking amazing.  I never had octopus that tender and the limoncello reduction over it was genius.  \n",
      "3. Fried Calamari - common item... but damn when it is done this well, I don't want it anywhere else. \n",
      "4. Hanger Steak Carpaccio - special of the night and pretty much a pile of arugula with a delicious steak carpaccio underneath and over it.\n",
      "5. Affettati Misti - selection of house cured meats with a variety of grilled peppers.  The pork belly seriously just melts in your mouth.\n",
      "6. Grilled Foie Gras - umm..... yes yes yes.  I think they drizzled a balsamic reduction over it too.  Crap.. I'm seriously drooling right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the pastas, each dish are all appetizer servings but if you want, you can add $15 more to make it into entree size.  All the pasta dishes are much more about the ingredients.  They brought out:\n",

      "1. Potato Gnocchi Bolognese - just.. really really solid gnocchi with a really good bolognese.  Wish there was more bolognese though.\n",
      "2. Puttanesca - olives, capers, and anchovies with penne.  Simple but so good.\n",
      "3. Beef Cheek Ravioli - beef cheek = one of the most tender cut of meat ever and they even drizzle aged real balsamic over it.  Yea.  Heaven.\n",
      "4. Black Truffle Pasta - when this came out, I was just... at a loss for words since it had real shaved slices of black truffle all over it rather than the typical truffle oil you see at many places.  The spaghetti itself with made with extra yolk too so the texture was amazing.  Favorite out of all.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the meats, they bring it all out and they carve it off the bone right in front of you:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Veal chop - tender, perfectly done.  The bone-in probably gave it extra flavor.\n",
      "2. Dry-aged Bone-in Ribeye - I love the seasoning and the crust.  Italian seasoned steaks is just good eating.  I still think Gallagher's dry-age beef is better though!\n",
      "3. Lamb Chops - ok this was the best lamb I've had.  I'm not a big fan of lamb because of the gaminess, BUT somehow it's all good and it is absolutely amazing.  \n",
      "4. Pork Chop - done medium well, and the way it is brined gives what seems like a really boring piece of pork good flavors.\n",
      "5. Maine Lobster ****TAIL**** - they only brought out one so it was kinda hard to share among all of us but... it was buttery goodness!  hahah.\n",
      "\n",
      "They also brought out two sides: mashed potatoes with marscapone & guanciale (type of unsalted bacon) with raw egg yolk mixed in, and sauteed mushrooms & onions.  Both were perfect as side dishes.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first we were afraid that we weren't gonna get full since the appetizer and pastas' portions were not big at all but after everything, we couldn't finish all the protein and it ended up being the perfect late night snack after XS :P\n",

      "If you come with a big group, definitely think about getting the \"family-style\" since you'll get to truly taste what Carnevino is all about.  Just expected to drop... quite a bit of money especially if you order wine and after the 20% gratuity charge.\n",

      "The dessert selection was amazing too....chocolate cups with creme and strawberries, creme bruelee, a variety of cakes, pies and cookies and gelato. I was so stuffed I couldn't move! This is surely one of the best buffet I have tried in Vegas. \n",

      "\n",
      "A thing to note is that these are tapas and the portions are small. We paid about 40 dollars a person which I felt was really affordable with the quality of food and presentation.

Ox ****TAIL**** Chili, cheese and a fried egg on top of a mound of crispy fries.  That's enough for me to come back.  Then the burger.

I honestly thought the idea of Ox ****TAIL**** Chili Cheese Fries could have been executed better. Hmmn...maybe like more sweetness to the ox tail? Ox tail reminds me of braised beef, so if that slow cooked turned sweet tasting taste was drenched all over fries... I think I would have liked it much better. The chili all over the fries was okay. I sort of avoided eating it... weird I know since it defeats the purpose of having chili on this dish. \n",

      "\n",
      "I visited during weekday lunch hour and the line was not very long.  We were seated quickly (~15-20 mins). The dining room itself is very, very grand.  The way they designed makes you feel that you are surrounded by foods, in a good way (Foods were easily accessible, you just need to reach your hand out).  I had enough space between me and my neighbors, which is a nice thought.  There's a real studio on site where they film the show on certain dates.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Service is on the spot.  Our plates were taken out routinely and the drinks were refilled as soon as we finished it.  You can tell the level of service is high here and people do work hard compare to some other buffets on the strip.\n",

      "* Drinks are free (White/Red/Imported Beer) +++ for some alcohol lovers!!\n",
      "\n",
      "The food:  So many to choose from.  Got the standard world cuisine fare.  I tried at least one bite on most of the items,  more on some particular items.  I have to say the foods were all well presented and the taste is in between above-average to excellent for a buffet restaurant. \n",
      "\n",
      "Some of my personal favorites during lunch hours were their fried items (Chicken, Shrimp), steak, italian station, their Ox ****TAIL**** Soup is phenomenal.  Steak is decent, and I liked their salad and sushi station. Its actually better than some non-Japanese operated Sushi buffet in town!   I also liked the fact they have lots fresh cut fruits so I can get some fibers without cutting /preparing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dessert station is another highlight of this buffet.  There are so many to choose from.  Cakes, Fruit Tarts, Mousses, Cookies, Macaroons.. They made it infront of you, and this is the same items that are selling at the M resort cafe at the entrance of the Casino area.  I also LOVE their gelato.  Made from scratch daily, 18 flavors to choose from , plus the toppings of your choice.  I tried most of them , and the only place that have smiliar quality in terms of dessert was Wynn, but they don't have as many varities as Studio B buffet, and you are paying much more $ for it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Feel stuffed? There's also fresh pressed espresso/coffee that's made to order!  Whoever designed/organized this buffet should be awarded for their thoughfulness.  Without this attractive buffet, I think  M resort would lose alot of clients due to their geographic locations (about 10 miles from the strip).\n",

It was the first visit for me and my wife and we have already been again while I am writing this review.....LOL. We have had the Apple Fritters.....Twists.....Tiger ****TAIL****s or Tiger Claws as some people call them.....Soy Custard filled doughnut.....lemon filled.....and the Doughnut holes. \n",

Now here is one thing to keep in mind the owners of the establishment like to \"make deals\" so to speak and they will often give you doughnuts for cheaper than they actually are.....LOL!!!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is an example of what I am talking about: Special Doughnuts are 1.60 each while all others are .85 cents each. Since we ordered 4 special Doughnuts and 1 regular Doughnut our total should have been 7.25 we paid only 7 bucks. The Doughnut Holes were 1.20 for a dozen he charged us only a buck. Now I know these are not huge savings but I thought it was a nice touch to show the customers some love.....LOL!!!!! So if your ever in Vegas and you want to eat Doughnuts to your blue in the face and NOT FEEL GUILTY stop on over at Ronald's Donuts. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!!\n",

I enjoyed an appetizer of Fried Gator ****TAIL****s with the snazzy cocktail sauce along with a basket of fried crawfish with fries and toasted french bread.  Since Outback got rid of the crawfish pasta dish I loved so much, I am so happy to have a place to enjoy crawfish!  The 5-star rating is for their willingness to switch almost any dish to crawfish just for me.  Well, they will do the same for you as well.\n",

I've taken my ex-hisband there, my current husband and most of all my friends, and u know it's good if my ex will go w me even though we hate each other.  I luv there Broiled rice balls w/umeboshi (plum) inside and ther tatsu-age (fried boneless chicken),  the Ochazke w/plum is a must when you're feeling sick, at first u wouldn't like it, but now everyone craves it when they're sick.\n",

      "Trying to figure out where to eat, someone suggested trying this place after he saw it on DDD. I looked it up and remembered I already had bookmarked it after seeing so many great reviews, we had to go!\n",
      "Upon arriving we did run into a little snag, there seemed to be a bit of a wait and a lot of people in the group were getting grumpy.. We almost left, but my ever hungry friend really wanted to eat here, unusual for a guy who didn't want to wait to meet his idols Penn & Teller! Maybe his foodie senses were tingling. I knew mine were, the burgers coming out to people's tables looked amazing.\n",
      "\n",
      "We stood around for a while, then we were moved to the back porch so we can sit while we waited. There were quite a few empty tables for a place that had a long wait, I can only assume they only seat people they can feed so people don't get pissed that the food is taking too long to come out. Makes sense I suppose.\n",
      "We finally got seated after waiting almost 45 minutes.\n",
      "From there things improved, food came out relatively quickly.\n",
      "We started with the Ox ****TAIL**** Chili Fries. Impressively good, it disappeared quickly.\n",
      "When it came time to choose my burger I had a hard time deciding, they all looked so good! It was a tie between The KiKi and Mr Ho. A few others wanted to try Mr. Ho, so I chose the KiKi and a Mr. Ho to split with the group.\n",
      "As we waited we snacked on the Salt & Pepper Garlic fries, which had some fresh ginger thrown in which I wasn't expecting, a nice surprise as I love ginger.\n",
      "Our burgers came out fairly quickly. My KiKi was pretty good, the Shogun my ever hungry friend had was really good, but the Mr. Ho pretty much stole the show with it's combination of beef and Lup Cheong sausage on top not to mention it's purple Taro bun! It's a good example of how you don't need to spend $25 on a burger, at $10 Mr Ho is a bargain.\n",

All right, enough of the interior design, on to the food!\n",

      "Appetizer - Caesar Salad with Polenta Croutons, Parmesan, and Eggless Garlic Dressing: During Restaurant Week, I ate my share of Caesar salads from one restaurant to the next, and this one was the best because of the polenta croutons that were crunchy and soft at the same time. I wish I could eat this salad every day. \n",
      "\n",
      "Main Course - My Dad's Bucatini Carbonara with Pancetta, Cracked Black Pepper, and Egg: One word: Divine. Ok, maybe a few more descriptive terms like creamy, pleasing to the palate. I would lick the entire bowl if no one was looking. \n",
      "\n",
      "Dessert - Cannoli: Good, but not the best that I've had. It definitely packs a crunch and isn't too sweet as is, but there's always the option to sweeten it up further by dipping it into the chocolate sauce that it's paired with. \n",
      "\n",
      "Not on the Restaurant Week Menu. \n",

They have all kinds of combinations to choose from. The burgers at Bachi are influenced by familiar and not so familiar, Asian and Hawaiian flavors. Burger like: \"Mr. Hos Burger\" (Angus Beef, Pork, Garlic, Ginger, Sautéed Mushrooms, Lup Cheong Sausage, Mizuna Lettuce, on a Taro Bun), \"Shogun Burger\" (Wagyu Beef, UNAGI!!!

So, to dine at the first one of two Vongerichten restaurants in Las Vegas was a no-brainer.   \n",

For deserts we tried the Chocolate Cake w/Toffee Sauce, Caramelized Peanuts, and Peanut Butter Ice Cream, Basil Sorbet and Vanilla Ice Cream. All wonderful dishes with my personal favorite being Butterfish Tetaki, Kobe Beef Dumplings, King Crab Leg, and Peanut Butter Ice Cream. Every flavor you simply wanted to savor, disappointed as it faded but only to be delighted when the next dish appeared. The food was a true transcendental culinary experience.  Five stars does not do it justice. \n",
      "\n",
      "The service was about as perfect as I have ever experienced. Ryan our waiter for both nights (we requested him the second night) was like a sherpa guide taking us to new culinary heights. Nearly all our dishes were direct recommendations from him catering to our tastes but also helping us explore new tastes. His attention to detail was superb including having a chilled Voss water ready for us the second night, remembering my wife's drink, answering a question about the vanilla ice cream from the night before (yes they do scrap the vanilla bean seeds into the ice cream), bringing us the basil sorbet as a palette cleanser as we had suggested before, surprising us with a dish not on the menu, etc. Charles \"I am a young Wayne Newton\" Tansey III even stopped by to let us know that our disappointment with the chocolate cake (a bit dry and lacking flavor) had been addressed with the chefs especially after having tried it himself.  Charles was even kind enough to walk out with us to the valet. Again five stars does not do it justice.\n",

      "The service was about as perfect as I have ever experienced. Ryan our waiter for both nights (we requested him the second night) was like a sherpa guide taking us to new culinary heights. Nearly all our dishes were direct recommendations from him catering to our tastes but also helping us explore new tastes. His attention to detail was superb including having a chilled Voss water ready for us the second night, remembering my wife's drink, answering a question about the vanilla ice cream from the night before (yes they do scrap the vanilla bean seeds into the ice cream), bringing us the basil sorbet as a palette cleanser as we had suggested before, surprising us with a dish not on the menu, etc. Charles \"I am a young Wayne Newton\" Tansey III even stopped by to let us know that our disappointment with the chocolate cake (a bit dry and lacking flavor) had been addressed with the chefs especially after having tried it himself.  Charles was even kind enough to walk out with us to the valet. Again five stars does not do it justice.\n",

Yonaka delivers in all aspects from ambiance, location, service, presentation, and of course the food.  This has been bookmarked ever since I read Cathy L's review in January.  Also, the current Duke of Yonaka aka Arvin C and his beautiful wife C-Dub also recommended this place to us.  So it's set.  Me, Sugi, and T-Elite changed our original Friday night plans and headed here for dinner.  Best decision we made all week.  Yonaka is legit!!!\n",

I had their Horse Mackerel Nigiri, Yellow ****TAIL**** Nigiri, Yellow ****TAIL**** Hamachi, Yellow ****TAIL**** Shashimi, Spicy Tuna Hand Roll, Asparagus w/rice crisp & spicy mustard, and their Spider Roll.  Come to think of it, this is a lot of food that I just ate for about $30.  Every dish is prepared and presented like a piece of art.  You have to check out the pictures to know exactly what I'm talking about. I don't think a review does the food any justice.  You just have to come by and check them out for yourself. \n",

How often do you go to a restaurant where the staff shakes your hand and introduces themselves to you?  Think about it for a second.  Here, they do exactly that. We even had two servers (Ashley and Mike) and they were both attentive.  One thing they do here at Yonaka is that they serve each of your dishes one at a time.  This means no crowded table full of empty plates and no food confusion.  I think they watch when you're about done with one of your dishes, then serve the next one.  Perfect timing here and I love it.  When we were done eating, Jax gave us her number so we can spread the word. I guess she knew we were all very satisfied. \n",

It was really good.  The fried egg on top just made it even better.  The ox tail meat was savory and soft, melt in your mouth.  I tried the Ronin Burger, which is the most popular but I didn't really like it.  There was too much carmelized onions which I usually love but it made the burger too sweet.  My husband had the Miyagi-san's Wagyu Burger and it was so awesome!!  I ate half of his burger.  It was really savory and just good.  I wanted to try their Boba drinks but I was too full after.

      "this review is strictly for this location. ( the one above Walgreens)  My husband and i have been long time fans of bouchon bakery... so much that we have to stop by each time we leave.  our must gets are usually the ham and cheese croissant and ham and cheese sandwich / turkey sandwich.  This past weekend ( easter) , we stayed at the palazzo and walked to this tucked away location thinking we could beat the line.  we got there and were the only ones there ...so here we were thinking yay we scored.  The girl behind the counter did not greet us right away... not that it mattered if she was busy .. but she wasnt and when she did she was not very friendly.  I placed my order of the ham and cheese croissant and waiting for it to be heated up.  IN the meantime, my husband wanted to place an additional order but this girl was just ignoring him.  It took almost like 2 minutes before she asked if he needed some help or if he wanted to order.  yeah granted we came together, maybe that can be confusing, but i thought it was pretty obvious that he needed to place to order.  Anyways, after 2 minutes she finally acknowledged that we wanted more sandwiches.  Again she was not friendly, and almost borderline giving us an attitude. But we didnt say anything; we just stayed quiet and just waited patiently for our sandwiches.  At the other locations, the staff normally would put the whole sandwich in the panini press but this girl... she took the sandwich apart and then heated it .  \n",

      "11:30 we walked in & greeted by the bus person. We ordered our food at 11:40 am.  I ordered coffee & asked the waiter for French Vanilla creamer. After waiting 10 minutes, I figured it slipped his mind.  So no biggie I asked the bus lady politely for creamer.  Our waiter over heard me asking her,  apologized & poured the cup of creamer. \n",

      "Now I'm starting to notice the people across from us had just gotten their food 35 minutes after we ordered. 12:15pm we asked the bus lady to check on our food she tells us the cook was by himself today.  Oh GREAT!  12:20 rolls around and they served my bf's french toast cold & set his side order in front of me.  So I didn't get my food at all. Lovely.  My bf walks up to tell them his food is cold & the waiter told us, \"it JUST came out\".  The food & plate were cold. So cold the butter didn't even melt! Ha, insulting our intelligence is strike 2. Then he says,  since we had not ate anything we could leave. My response was \"GOOD!\"\n",

Steer clear of this place to avoid food ****POISONING****. I thought it was way overpriced for the portion sizes from what I could tell from my bf's order.  It's okay if it's pricey & the food is top notch but that was unacceptable service. They shooed us out the door for their mix ups. I thought we were more than patient with how long the wait was when it wasn't busy. Very disappointed. At least if you're going to have LONG wait times,  give out public wifi.\n",

However, we should have immediately bounced from this place when it literally took 30 minutes to be seated, because the staff was just twiddling their thumbs instead of ringing up customers and seating them. Already epic fail on customer service.\n",

Everyone ordered a burger and a shake or two for the table as we admired the massive, decorated, boozy shakes at the tables around us. My friend with the strawberry shake raved about it- with fresh strawberries and they even delivered the extra in the metal cup it was made in- again, promising start to a meal!\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the burgers, however, that really let the meal down. Although we all ordered medium cooked burgers, what we were delivered ranged from rare to well-done. Also, all burgers lacked seasoning, and even the toppings didn't save the flavor. You know you have an issue when even an al pastor-style meat preparation lacks flavor! Since we waited, hungry, for our burgers for 20 min after ordering, no one was willing to send their burgers back so we scarfed them down, though this questionable meal came to haunt us later as my friend with the rarest burger became sick from the raw meat later that afternoon. I'm sorry, but food ****POISONING**** is definitely the nail in the coffin for this review. Lesson learned: when in Vegas, plan ahead and make reservations for brunch.\n",

We tried to sit at the tables inside, but the staff said that area was closed, and forced us to side outside in the \"patio\" area, where the seats were not very comfortable, and where it was colder (even though we were still inside the casino). Some of the meat in the panini was still cold when we got it, since it wasn't heated evenly.

We ordered a lot of different drinks, it took forever to get them and they were HORRIBLE. They all tasted like water, no alcohol at all. When you are paying 17 for a martini, they better put some alcohol in it. The guacamole was good but they put a huge piece of Romaine Lettuce in it so it takes up half of the bowl. Totally not worth it and definitely not for more than 2 people. 2 people at our table ordered the same item for dinner and they both came out missing an item. Are you kidding me?? They didn't bring the items back to the table until we were finished eating. We were here for a birthday and they never brought out the birthday dessert.

      "\n",
      "We came for lunch to check things out. We were kind of leery about making a huge commitment to ordering the AYCE option. First of all, we weren't that hungry and we had a Yelp event planned later in the evening. Secondly, the AYCE menu is $21 for lunch, consisted largely of carb heavy rolls and cooked items which didn't really appeal to us (there is no sashimi on the AYCE menu).\n",
      "\n",
      "Our server was slightly overly attentive to the point where she was checking every 2-3 minutes of us getting seated to put in our order.\n",

      "We ended up ordering 2 lunch specials. I got the sushi combo which comes with 4 pieces of nigiri and a choice of spicy tuna or California roll plus miso soup. ($10.95)The hubs got the bento box with a spicy tuna roll, tempura, salad and miso soup.($9.95)\n",

      "\n",
      "My sushi combo was supposed to be salmon, red snapper, tuna. The fish tasted very ummm...fishy in an unpleasant way with a slightly mushier texture than expected for sushi grade product. The rice was not seasoned well and was too firm. The maki spicy tuna roll incorporated way too much hot sauce so it suspiciously masked whatever flavor of fish that was in there. More on that later.\n",

      "\n",
      "Once seated the service was very slow.  I ordered a hot tea and had to wait 15 minutes and keep asking the server before he could find me a pot for my tea and bring it to the table.  My wife ordered a Pinot noir which took forever and we had to ask twice for that as well.  The glass did not appear to be as clean as it should have been and my wife said it had a salt taste on it.  She also ordered a kale salad.  I had the orange peel chicken which was ok, nothing special.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later that evening around 11:30 my wife started getting violently ill, all the signs of food ****POISONING****.  Needless to say it was not a good night and Friday was a long day in bed.  We did not eat out anywhere else so it had to come from cross contamination in something here.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Not sure what happened on Thursday at this place but they need to figure out what went wrong with the glass washing or food handling.  The quality was just not as good on Thursday as it had been in the past and they were definitely overwhelmed.  The service was not good on this day, according to our server running out of tea pots and trying to keep up.  Seeing how long it took to get a glass of wine and then noticing the glass was not entirely clean, not sure what happened in the back area but we will probably not be back to this place for sometime.  My wife never gets sick like that and this was the only place we went to and the experience seemed concerning to begin with.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the kicker, my wife called and talked to a manager who basically did not want to accept any responsibility and told her she should have gone to the doctor to be tested to prove it was food ****POISONING**** and it came from them.  It is strange how the manager knew exactly what my wife was talking about in relation to the taste on the glass but still refused to accept any responsibility.  The manager did say the chemical they use to clean the glasses is what could have caused the problem as it was supposed to be washed off completely and this may not have happened.  The chemical they use is very strong and if not washed completely off could have caused this.  The call from us was a courtesy call but was not accepted as one.  I guess we won't be back to this place....\n",

      "Quick update, this manager we talked to over the weekend said a GM would call my wife on Monday, today is Wednesday and still no call, says a lot about that location.

Not only is it extremely overpriced if you are just going to have some eggs or something basic or light, but my dining companion felt sick all day after eating here, skipped lunch, and threw up her breakfast at dinner time, so we are thinking it is most likely food ****POISONING**** from this place.\n",

I decided to take it home not wanting to waste food.  After trying it at home, I threw it away because it didn't taste right.\n",

      "I went here 4 months before and the dishes were hit and miss.  The the fried calamari was stale tasting and tasted like a quick defrost of frozen food left too long in the freezer.  The Texas Redfish Pontchartrain was excellent.  One of the best tasting fishes in the Phoenix area.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The 2 star is really for the hit and miss on certain items and for food ****POISONING****.  This is a shame because this was one of my favorite restaurant chain when I lived in Houston 20 years ago.\n",

      "I just came back from Vegas this weekend and stayed here.  It has been almost 10 years since I last stepped foot into this establishment.  The last time I was here, I had food ****POISONING**** and broke out in hives  from eating the crawfish at the buffet.  Had to go to the emergency room and get shot up with benadryl.  I did contact the manager and he comped me for a future stay.  \n",
      "Anyways, when I came back here this past weekend, nothing changed at all.  I did notice that there's a fresh scent in the lobby area.  Previously, it wreaked of smoke.  The elevator, hallway and room all looked the same.  Very disappointed at the decor.  I was pretty sure they would have done some kind of renovation.  The room looks so old and tacky and it make feel dirty.  The furniture is drab and the bathroom can look cleaner.  I noticed that the shelf in the bathroom was dusty.  I do believe they replaced their tube tv inside of the armoire with a flat screen.  Their wifi is a big fat joke.  They claim to provide you with free wifi, but it's so slow that there's no point.  I clocked it at under 1mb.  Who does that?  If you want faster speeds up to 10mb, you will need to fork over $10 per day.  Isn't that supposed to be covered in the resort fee?  I did get a chance to check out the fitness center.  For a hotel like this, I was surprised how decent it looked.  It was pretty roomy and the equipment looked new or unused.  I'd go with the latter as no one really works out when they are in Vegas.  Especially in an establishment like this.  \n",
      "The one thing I did like about this place is the casino.  The dealers are, for the most part, friendly.  The minimum to play is $5 and the cocktail waitress comes by frequently.  I usually never finish my beer before they come back, so I end up having to double fist my beers/cocktails.  Not complaining at all.  The band in the lounge area plays current music and they aren't bad at all.  Although, this is the same band that played here almost 10 years again.  The lounge is a nice place to chill if you want to get away from losing money to the house.  \n",
      "I don't see myself coming back here, but might just for the casino.\n",

      "\n",
      "Came here for the $40 prix fix dinner for 2 people because we though it was a great deal. For appetizer we got the Caesar Salad which was drenched in salad dressing and I was choking on the sticky dressing. Then we got the roasted chicken and the meatloaf entree. The chicken was very dry and lacking flavor but eatable. The meatloaf tasted like wet paper, I had 5 bites and the dude had a bite and refuse to eat anymore. Guess what from the extra several bites, I was up all night going to the bathroom and got no sleep! \n",

      "I hope it gets better with time, like a fine wine.  But the first sip of this new property was a bit underwhelming.  The approach is not smooth.  The designers must have forgotten this was in Vegas.  The cab approach and departure is far too congested and dangerous as well, with drunk pedestrians stumbling into the flow of traffic.\n",
      "\n",
      "The signage on the interior leaves a little to be desired.\n",

      "\n",
      "The food itself was not very memorable. Now, it might have been a jaded experience because I'd eaten at L'Atelier the night prior, but had I not taken picture of each dish as they came out, I wouldn't have remembered them.  It wasn't until the next day when I saw the hamachi dish that I recalled how good it was. I wish the entire tasting menu has consisted of that.  The oyster - meh. And now that I see that Sarah C.'s husband and coworker got food ****POISONING****, I'm pretty sure that's what made me sick too.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the most offensive dish was dessert.  I'll post a photo -- but believe me when I tell you this passionfruit mousse looked like a damn stick of room temperature butter.  In terms of flavor, it was pretty good -- but that's after you get the idea of eating butter out of your head.  Not an easy feat. \n",
      "\n",
      "The best part of the meal?  Another server who looked just like Kevin Spacey and had personality to boot. I wish he'd been our guy.\n",

      "Mountain:2\n",
      "Unfortunately this place has gone downhill...\n",
      "\n",
      "The quality of the fish wasn't great across the board and the only roll that was decent was the Viva Las Vegas roll which is fried so a lot of the flavor is covered up. The chicken skewers were undercooked which can lead to food ****POISONING**** and everything we ordered was on the bland side. As the happy hour prices go up the food quality goes down. \n",
      "\n",
      "I used to frequent this location several times a week when I worked at the Wynn and enjoyed it for many years. Tonight's dinner doesn't inspire me to come back. \n",
      "\n",
      "Service was nice but a tad awkward as our server doesn't like sushi. He kept recommending cooked items and I had to say to him that we are here for the sushi too & this place is called RA Sushi so it's interesting to have hired someone who isn't into raw fish. But my review doesn't reflect this at all. The food wasn't great.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mountain:2\n",
      "I heard and read a lot of good things about this place however my first experience with them wasn't a good one. I ordered the Ronnin burger $8? and parmesan truffle fries $4?. Let's just say the pictures I've seen were a lot better looking and larger. My fries were terrible they were all shriveled and over cooked, super salty. it was as if they got some left over fries from the fridge nuked them in the microwave and dumped a pill of parmesan and  garlic salt on it, no lesser in size than a medium fries from McDonald's. The burger was pretty tasty, but under cooked and sloppy made, buns was completely soggy and ingredients falling out before the first bite. there was also some nasty after taste from the slaw. I just expected more and wonder if I just caught them on a wrong day. They do have a unique menu that looks delicious which I'd like to try. So until then I'm fine with saying that this place is just an ok burger place.\n",

      "I ordered the Gacho sandwich with no bread and no dairy. I specifically asked her if there was any type of cheese and she said no. The cashier asked me if I wanted to turn that into a salad, I said sure. My friend ordered the bacon eggslut sandwich.\n",
      "Upon receiving our order I asked the guy who delivered it what the white stuff covering the salad was. He said cheese.\n",
      "I returned it because I told them I couldn't have dairy (I'm on a very strict diet right now) and he got the cashier to come over. She told me she said there wasn't dairy on the sandwich, she never said there wasn't cheese on the salad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now how does this make any sense. I understand the sandwich is $16 and they didn't want to lose out on that but how are you going to argue with a paying guest? In front of a ton of other guests mind you. I told her I'd gladly pay for another order but I absolutely cannot have dairy. They said no and they would just make me a new one. About 15 minutes pass and I finally receive the correct order. \n",
      "I bit into it and the meat was ice cold, the egg was luke warm. Even my boyfriend Andy who NEVER complains commented how cold it was.\n",

Albeit I didn't get food ****POISONING**** again, I found the food to be subpar - the service nonexistent - and the overall experience to be bleh. \n",
      "\n",
      "The only thing going for this place is the king crab legs. Hordes of Asian tourists line up for this. I will admit that to get this here for the price of $25-30 buffet dinner is aiiiight. But other than that, this place has nothing else worth eating. Many of the items were cold and/or bland. \n",

      "\n",
      "Mountain:2\n",
      "Ah, Todd English P.U.B., how you have failed me.  When this place first opened it was awesome!  The decor is nice and they have little hourglasses attached to the bar, which is part of their free beer promotion.  If you can drink a pint of beer in 7 seconds or less, it's free.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let me be clear.  I do not have that skill with any sort of liquid.  But some of my friends do so it was fun to go with them and watch.  The promotion used to be unlimited.  But, as these things go, the rumor from the staff is that someone ruined it by chugging 11 Guinesses in a short amount of time, bringing up questions of potential alcohol ****POISONING**** and lawsuits.  So they limited to 8 beers.  Fine.  That's reasonable.\n",
      "\n",
      "But then they limited to 4 beers for no apparent reason. Now the promotion, which part of their logo and permanent decor, is limited to 2 beers.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Their other promotion, 5 cent PBR night, has also gotten lame.  At first, when they started it in April, it was so laid back.  We'd sit at the bar and order the 5 cent PBRs (served in 8 oz plastic cups) during the requisite hours (Tues after 9pm).  Now, even if you spend $50+ at the bar beforehand, they make you get up and go outside to get a wristband.  I get that the promotion has become popular but, cmon.  If we've been sitting at the bar already, you hopefully know we are of age.  Just give us the damn wristband instead of making us go out in the cold to get it!\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, here's an interesting incident.  During 5 cent PBR night, the staff made a group a girls get up and give up their seats at the bar to a guy who wanted to order food.  The guy was extremely uncomfortable with this but the staff was insistent... they wanted the sale.  The guy made up for it by being nice to the girls, buying them drinks (besides 5 cent PBR) etc.  But WTF?\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the food has gone way downhill.  The dirty chips used to be extremely craveable.  Last time I got them, the portion size was smaller and they were nasty and soggy.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The staff here has been really good to me.  They'd make recommendations and let me try drinks beforehand that they thought were questionable.  I even got some free refills on cocktails and beer.  It was a fun place to go and chat with the nice bartenders.  I like the staff and really want to like this place, but I think management has cut corners for some reason and screwed it all up.  Alas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mountain:2\n",
      "The food was amazing, but there were some major trade-offs:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Our 45-60 minute wait lasted about 80 minutes. We had enough time to go back to our room, change, come back to the restaurant, and still wait long enough to be pretty hungry by the time we were seated. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. I got food ****POISONING****. While we shared all of our dishes, one of them had individual soft shell crabs, which was the majority of what I puked out later in the evening. I've since read about other food ****POISONING**** reports here, particularly connected to seafood, so I think there must be a problem. It left me sick for a full 24 hours, and worse, my immune system was so down from the dehydration and the dry winter weather in Vegas, this was followed by a cold that lasted several more days. \n",
      "\n",
      "As terrible as my illness was, I had a very tasty dinner before the aftermath, which makes it hard to write Lotus off completely:\n",
      "\n",
      "Red curry - amazing\n",
      "Fried spicy catfish - solid\n",
      "Drunken noodle soft shell crab - good noodles, bad crabs\n",

      "Mountain:2\n",
      "I wouldn't recommend this buffet. The customer service is terrible. It's tough to eat at a buffet without a single water refill. \n",

      "Like many have mentioned, Studio B includes alcoholic beverages in their buffet. They give you the choice of red wine, white wine, zinfandel, champagne, beer/lager, or cider. Then on the dessert end of the buffet, you could definitely request an Irish coffee.  Best part? Unlimited. You are allowed as many glasses as you would like as long as you don't vomit everything you ate back onto the buffet floor afterwards. I suppose depending on whether or not you drink these, this would be a home run for you. However, for someone like me -- who can barely eat her fair share at a buffet let alone drink her fair share of alcohol ... it is not something I look for in a buffet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Studio B's prime rib is absolutely delicious. I'm not quite sure if I'm saying this because I was absolutely starving after the 3 hour wait to get in or if I really thought it was delicious. I couldn't really tell you. I could tell you that it was good. I've had prime ribs at many other buffets before and when I had Studio B's on Thanksgiving night, it definitely left an impression. \n",
      "\n",
      "There is a definitely good variety of food. They have seafood on weekends. They have a sushi corner, fruit corner, salad corner, Asian, southern, Italian, meat cutting stations, and a dessert area. I'm sure there's more but I can't quite remember. Some of my favorites (from the past and from recent) would probably be the spicy jellyfish salad, spicy cucumber salad, prime rib, fruit and dessert areas!\n",
      "\n",
      "The service? Could be good or could be bad. It really depends. We've had a server who actually told us that wet towelettes are one per person at a table when we went one time for their seafood buffet. Forreal? You going to tell us that? Yeah, we switched servers and the next one just grabbed a whole bunch and plopped it right on our table. Our most recent server for Thanksgiving night -- her name is Pat and she is amazing. Quick, fast, and just an overall happy person to be around. \n",
      "\n",
      "Price? I suppose you can say it's decent for a Las Vegas buffet on the strip. And when I mean strip, I mean far end of the strip that no one really knows about half the time. It's $40 per person for their Dinner Seafood buffet, which is offered on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. Monday-Thursdays Dinners are $24 per person. I find their Seafood dinner buffets on the pricier side. When they first opened, it used to be at the lower end of the $20's and seafood was offered every night. Back then, Studio B was a steal. It was literally the BEST BUFFET in Las Vegas. Now? With it's price, it's average standing to me.\n",

      "\n",
      "When we got into the buffet, I pigged out. Yeah, I ate a little bit of everything that looked good. I had some assorted sushi rolls because I was craving for some spicy tuna and they had it. I typically avoid their sushi roll section cause I'm always worried that they aren't fresh. But hell, if they have it out, it should be edible and safe. I also had some crawfish, clams & mussels, veggies, meats, oxtail soup, lobster bisque, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was so FULL. I could literally EXPLODE. My stomach felt so HUGE. And then 20 minutes after, right before we got home, something felt VERY wrong. Like it felt  TERRIBLY wrong. I felt the need to hug the toilet. The were huge red flags and warning bells going off in my head. My father's driving started to nauseate me. And without a doubt, when I got home ... everything I ate had came right out. And like clockwork to every food ****POISONING**** event, sharp stabs of pain convulsed my stomach every so often -- making me curl into a ball on the ground. What did I eat? The only thing I ate different from my family (they didn't get sick) was the assorted sushi rolls, crawfish, and clam & mussels. \n",

      "In the end. Two stars. Yeah the buffet is great and decent but if there are foods I HAVE to avoid eating just because you can't do it right, why bother? Just take it off. I have no interest in having a repeat of this fiasco. I'd rather pay a little bit more of money to go to a buffet that won't make me sick and has rack of lamb on their menu. Thanks.\n",

I would recommend passing on this location as all the meats were dry, they did not have enough people cleaning tables so that was the main reason there was a huge backup in the line, and overall the variety was above average but the quality was sub par. At least I didn't get food ****POISONING****?\n",

I was with 4 others who also didn't want to look further, needless to stay buffet was not my first choice and especially this one, I never get my money's worth.  But when hunger strikes you'll eat anything, and we were so hungry buffet sounded good at the time.  \n",
      "Located at Aria's promenade.  It was about $35 per adult for late lunch.  The place is nice, clean, modern, and staff very efficient.  They selection of food was the downfall for me.  I did a walk through before starting, looked pretty good.  Its when I actually started to select food when I thought wow this is not great, my plate was pretty empty.  \n",
      "Buffets I always start with my main dishes.  I went to the craving station got a prime rib and a small slice of leg of lamb, both ok leg of lamb was dry but prime rib was good.  Other options sausages, roasted chicken, and turkey.  I added some side dishes I went to the \"Italian\" section and grabbed some antipasto.  Again nothing special.  Went back to my seat.  Started with that.  \n",
      "They had salad bar, which I usually ignore at buffets but I made a small side salad just to get some veggies in. Italian with a made to order past bar,  pizza so on I skipped, small Indian section about 3 dishes, I grabbed a naan bread and topped it with butter chicken not even worth mentioning, an Asian section with not very appetizing dim sum, dry looking noddles, and the rice even looked sad I skipped this whole section.  They had a \"sushi\" section with 3 different types of roll, this was very disappointing.  The seafood section looked pretty promising crab legs, mussels, prawns so on both hot or cold.  This section is where you'd get your money's worth.  I tried some of the warm seafood salty but was good.  Warm butter was a nice touch.  The dessert bar with its many options of ice cream, cookies, pies, and cakes.  Non really made me happy left me feeling wanting more, and not a feeling you want after a buffet.  I decided to have more fruits instead, watermelon and pineapple where great.  With the many options of a buffet in Vegas this is in the bottom of my list.  And to top it all off 2 people in my group had some type of food ****POISONING****, I guess being picky with my food selection worked out because I felt ok.\n",

      "\n",
      "I don't know why they call their beef \"roasted beef\" rather than using the fancy prime rib. Maybe it was a different area of the cow? But that huge roasted slab of meat did look wonderful.

What the hell, I gave it a shot and I don't know that I'll be rushing back to do so again. It had a creamy texture and tasted mostly of the ponzu sauce I'd dipped it in. It was OK but rather odd and it looked like golf ball sized brains!\n",

Yes, some are better and some are worse, but this buffet falls right in the middle between a must visit and a completely avoid.

The menu of what they serve here hasn't changed in the last four years so they'll probably stick to what they have. Most things to eat are a serious hit or miss and the only real consistent thing I've had are the pastas, which are totally not good for you but really tasty in my opinion.

      "--- T&T (Tacos & Tequila) Cantina - By far, this is the coolest and best experience offered here.  I didn't get a chance to eat here, and feel like I missed out.  Next time in Vegas, it's on my list to dine at.  Not only beautifully designed, but they had one of the best mariachi bands I've ever heard.\n",

The eggs Benedict was served on a roll, not the typical kind I'm used to. The shrimp was, well shrimpy. There was a long line to wait for the carving station. When I got the roast beef back to the table, it was rather fatty- a low quality of beef. \n",

With that said, the lines were even LONGER than usual, but it's Vegas, the lines for the buffets, except for breakfast are always long.

      "The Carnival World buffet, once you get past the line(again for breakfast; at roughly 8:30AM there was NO line at all, but less of a selection as well, so it's better to go for the latter of the two meals) is probably one of the most comprehensive ones as far as food coverage.  They sample such a variety of things that it's tough to remember them all, but from east to west, it's mostly there.  Pasta, to steak and prime rib, to asian food, to salad to dessert.   Usually, the food is pretty good, but with any buffet, especially one that's literally catering to about 1000 people per day, it won't be the best quality.   Esp when it comes to items such as seafood or meat on the rare-side...everything tends to be on the more-cooked side; I'm assuming simply to avoid lawsuits for food ****POISONING**** on things of that matter...  Anyway, probably one of the bigger buffets available.  My advice, a little of everything goes a long long way :)\n",

      "The place is pretty huge, so there's more than enough room to seat a large party; you'll just have to wait a little bit.  I would recommend to just break your party up into a couple of smaller groups and see if you can get seated near each other, usually works wonders.\n",

However, I didn't know about it then, and had thus concluded that all of Phoenix was an armpit (remember, I only had the immediate surrounding environs of Greenway & the I-17 to go by those days).

      "But anyway, I decided to go here for lunch today, taking two vegetarian lunch companions with me. We got there (a nondescript stripmall, which makes missing this place while driving past it for 2 straight weeks completely understandable) and noticed that hordes of techie-looking guys dressed in khakis, polo shirts, and IT company badge lanyards were also making their way inside.

Needless to say, having a long line gave me time to try and figure out their menu, written on sushi order-style long strips of paper. Eventually as I neared the register (the line moves pretty fast) I decided on the red jade chicken burrito, jerk fried rice, black beans, and veggie salad (the last one just to make me feel a little better about eating the first three). \n",

But again, that didn't deter every seat from being occupied. This place was hugely popular. Like local institution popular. I'm not even kidding.\n",

      "My colleagues and I sat in the smaller adjoining room and wondered how we were going to get our food. Then a spirited server walked in the room carrying a tray full of stuff. \"An order for Jim! An order for Bob! An order for, uh, Sur...Surinder!\" My colleagues and I then debated about this. I'm sure the Chino folks could easily give customers a number to put on their tables a la Pei Wei/Wildflower/many other places, but the whole servers wandering around yelling people's names constantly gave an extra element of atmosphere to the place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually our food came, along with three aforementioned Snickerdoodles. I poured some of my habanero salsa all over my foil bowl and sampled everything. Beans? Decent. Jerk fried rice? Pretty tasty. Salad? Eh - standard cheap shredded lettuce with shredded cheese on top. But the burrito was interesting. It was effectively sweet & sour chicken (but tastier) rolled up in a tortilla. Maybe I'm just easily amused, but I thought it was a really cool concept. I then noticed other guys getting red jade chicken in quesadilla form, which also looked really good.  I then sat back and surveyed everything in my bowl - a combination of Mexican, Caribbean, and Americanized-Chinese food all mashed up together. Pretty cool, I'd say.\n",
      "\n",
      "My colleagues enjoyed their food, too, which is always key when carnivores and herbivores can both be satisfied with the same dining location. And when we left the place at 12:30, I'd say the whole place was now 70% empty and completely bereft of khaki pants, which was a little weird. I guess 11:30-12:30 must be the IT golden munching hour.  \n",

      "  Wait:  Breakfast we showed up at 10:00 am, 2-3 people ahead of us in line, quickly seated.  Dinner, about 6 people ahead of us, the cashier took no time to get to, but getting a table for 6 took a little while, and was slightly annoying (probably about 10-15 mins)....probably would've been easier if there wasn't some wedding banquet going on on the other side of the restaurant. We ended up doing the..lets' just stand next to the table of 6 grannies not eating and chatting..and talk real loud about how hungry we are and how we wish we had  a table that could hold six people..I think they got the hint and left quickly.  \n",

      "Dinner - was awesome. The different stations for different cuisine was good too.  The middle east kabobs were very good..i liked the lamb a lot, but the Chicken was kind've weird (marinated in chasu sauce which is chinese and reserved for pork).  Mexican looked like your standard Taco bar...I passed. The roast beef was very good, potato bar had some nice options. Asian cuisine had terrible egg rolls (as expected), but the tempura shrimp was good (too bad no dipping sauce). the quality of sushi was very good though..so I grabbed a lot..(*tip*..eat the raw fish as sashimi only..screw the rice)..salmon, tuna, eel...Wanna-be Sushi conossiuers would you prefer me to use the japanese names?!?  Okay fine...meji, sake, and unagi. i took 4 years of japanese but it's horrible..hahah..\n",
      "  Anyway, the italian station was very good as well...as they had a variety of different pastas..the lobster pasta was quite tasty, and the cheese raviolis as well..The pizza looked good too, but i passed as..I did not spend $25 to eat pizza. Lastly the seafood..which mainly composed of Oysters and Alaskan King crab was good..I did not try the oysters (i try only to eat premium oysters for fear of food ****POISONING****)...but the alaskan king crab legs were great and plentiful..of course a line for that, but not too bad...once you got past the little old ladies who always stakced 20 legs on their plate...just do your part as well. The soups were good as well...I had a creamy Tomato Basil soup..nice.\n",

OK, items like the salmon, surf clam, red snapper, and eel didn't taste like the freshest cuts ever. In fact, there was an overall sogginess to both the fish and the rice, and some of the pieces came drowning in sauce, but they didn't taste \"off\" or awful either. Maybe the fact that I experienced no discomfort or food ****POISONING**** afterwards is a low hurdle to clear, but nothing about the fish or their preparation methods was alarming or concerning.\n",

The service was great though not quite impeccable. There were a couple minor things here and there... refilling of water could've been better and maybe more check-ins here and there. If I were a teacher, I'd give the service 95 out of 100%. The ambiance felt intimate despite the restaurant being large and having high ceilings. The dim lighting, bistro-like interior, and dark wood panels helped offset the intimidating size.\n",

Now, the only reason why I give this place 4 stars as opposed to 5 is because my friend *likely* got food ****POISONING**** from here. We were examining his day thinking about what he ate/drank that day and the day before and nothing was questionable except perhaps the scallops. So while we cannot determine if it was from here, from our conclusions, it probably was from a bad scallop or one that was underprepared. At the time, however (to be fair to the restaurant and the entree itself!), it was delicious according to my friend! \n",

That culture has a really fun attitude about boozing, and some of the best drinks in the world. Whisky, beer and Irish cream, awesome. Second, this place has great food. It's rare to find an awesome bar, that also has awesome food. Usually I can either a) tolerate the food or b) drink enough crappy beer to not care how bad the booze is, even though the food rocks. I really love the second level of this bar. It's a huge high ceiling-ed place with dark, rich wood bars and cozy lighting. They pump Irish music in (not too loud) to add to it. There's lots of Irish decor and pictures as well. \n",

      "1. They do a lot of private parties here. You may be turned away every night of your stay.\n",
      "2. Prices seem significantly higher. $10 for a pint of Guinness, and it's (probably) neither an imperial or even full pint.\n",
      "3. Food seems to be out of stock a lot. Certainly dishes were out of stock several times.\n",
      "4. Service. We used to LOVE the bartenders here (especially Dave, the Mexican guy and the guy who served us \"shaleighleighs.\" Since then, the staff is almost indignant and sometimes approaching rude.\n",
      "5. I HATE to say it, but I definitely got food ****POISONING**** here once (it was the only place I had eaten in 24 hours, so I know it was them.) It wouldn't stop me from returning or recommending this place, but it's my first thought when we enter here.\n",

      "More on the good (I feel like I left too many negatives.) Food is great here. Everything I've had was top notch. The sausage pail is one of my favorites. It's small, deep fried sausages in a little 'bucket.' They are super tender and juicy. It's a meal for two. They also have Guinness pies, which kinda like empanadas or similar. Very good, but kinda skimpy. The baked brie is good, but also a little skimpy. I like the crab dip a lot. It was very flavorful and fresh. They have a huge selection of whiskies and mixed drinks here. They actually have some interesting concoctions on their menu. They also serve several Irish beers and of course, Guinness. I highly recommend this place, with a bit of caution towards being able to even get in. Pretty much, if you can get in, I'd do it. But I wouldn't go way out of my way to do so, anymore. I really wish it was still a 5 star, but it's hard to say I love a place where the service has failed recently, and I can't even get into! Anyway, enjoy it, if you can. Slainte!\n",

Fresh butter, basil, Marzano tomatoes, al dente pasta, pork ragu- the works!!! This has definitely forever raised my standards for room service food!

I shared the room with 2 of my other friends. The shower was nice with a phone by the toilet. I was surprised that there were 3 phones in the room. Sorry, I don't travel to Vegas all that much, this was my 3rd trip, and first since 20020ish. The food court here sucks though. Fuddruckers wasn't bad, Sabarro was decent, but I got sick of it after a while, and one of my friend got food ****POISONING**** at the Subway from their meatball sub. So, just a warning.

      "Had a ball at this swank and hip Asian style barbecue bar. It feels like an Americanized Asian gastro pub. Very high quality Korean BBQ. Replete with the grill in the center and semi self-cooking (but enough assistance so you don't get yourself into trouble and accidentally give yourself food ****POISONING****). Service is strong and sincere. I couldn't ask for better. Someone bright and foot- forward immediately greets you upon arrival. The atmosphere is dark and broody, but hilarious and elegant at the same time. How shall I say? It's a girl who wears Burberry but has a goth Asian tattoo. It was fairly busy on a Friday night after 9, but didn't feel crowded. They seem to keep tables moving, as our wait was only 20 minutes. And it was fine. The little benches make you feel you are part of the action. And there is cool K-pop (Korean popular music, for us gringos) as well as videos playing. Fun atmosphere. And you will feel just as comfortable whether North or South of 30.\n",

Our group didn't come with us for this lunch...so they insisted on coming the next day.  Fast forward next day... at 830am we get there and voila, NO ONE.  Not one person was there, no line, nothing.  We sat right in the middle and the 4 of us proceeded to order our food.  As we were waiting for our stews to cook, all of the sudden the whole place was full of diners... lol.  So we figure the magic hour is between 8am and 9am.

      "I love Brazilian churrascaria.  It's got to be one of my favorite eating experiences, EVER.  So why not go like all the time?  Hmm.  Honestly, it's not the price tag which is usually $40-60 per person.  It's all the tasty meat.  All that meat all the time and I'd die of meat ****POISONING****.  Albeit a great churrascaria will also have a fantastic salad bar.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I've driven by this Texas de Brazil so many times I can't count.  And I don't even live in Vegas.  So finally I made a date to come eat here when I met all my friends here.  It was 5 of us that came to eat and we were not disappointed.  I made a reservation prior and we came on a Saturday night.  Seated without issue, our server asked us if we've ever eaten at a Brazilian Churrascaria.  I told him that I had, so I could break it down to the rest of my table.  He also gave us menus and told us if we saw something on the menu and if that meat didn't come around, then we could tell him which meat we wanted and he'd get the kitchen to bring to us.  Absolutely spot on because we did this a couple times with him and sure enough, he got the kitchen to bring out our selected meats.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I also asked him for a recommendation on a wine.  Chrurrascarias are the usual spots I get a chance to drink South American wine which is pretty tasty.  I asked for a South American wine and he recommended a really, fantastic one.  Only cost us about $20 also.  \n",
      "\n",
      "What else is there to write about?  So much meat.  I mean so much.  So much that I honestly don't remember half of what I ate.  Though to be perfectly honest, I didn't feel that every piece of meat we got served was perfect or amazing.  There were some selections that were just \"ok\" and we definitely didn't get a 2nd serving of them.  But you get served so much meat it gets hard to track what you've eaten and what you haven't.\n",
      "\n",
      "The salad bar's strong also.  Great selection of enough foods that I wish other vegetarian restaurants had the same bar.  Sigh.  Ironic when a charrascaria does a better salad bar than most vegetarian places I've eaten at.\n",
      "\n",
      "And finally dessert.  But dessert is not part of the dinner price.  It's extra but worth it.  Again, we got 5 different desserts and I can't even remember what they all were but they were outstanding.  A great way to finish after all that meat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now this wasn't the best churrascaria I've ever eaten at, but close.  Ice wine on the menu would have been the tops!  What really made our eating experience the tops was our waiter.  He was outstanding.  Some of the best service I've honestly ever gotten.  We actually asked him for a recommendation to the best strip club in Vegas and he suggested some.  Then 5-10 minutes later he came back and told us that he gave bad recommendations and named some other ones!  What!  So he actually went back to his staff and asked them so he could give us a better recommendation.  That's beyond service.  We gave him a 20% tip and I threw in another $20 on top of that.  Seriously, if you're reading this right now, you are a total pimp.\n",

      "This is going to be a long story.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I went to my 1st Brazilian churrascaria at the Fogo de Chao in Chicago back in 2009.  It was awesome.  Probably one of the greatest eating experiences I have ever had.  Since then I've ventured to many other churrascarias (read my Texas de Brazil review) and always compared them to my 1st time.  Well, what a delight when I was visiting Vegas and saw that a Fogo de Chao finally opened up a location here.  So I invited my friend Angela to eat here.  And she's never been to a churrascaria so I was pretty excited.\n",
      "\n",
      "I book a reservations online for opening dinner time, 1700.  Was really easy and no issues with booking.  We actually got there early and sat at the bar.  We took a look at their special menu of caipirinhas and asked the bartender what his recommendations were.  He was pretty awesome because he actually told us not to order certain drinks because he thought they didn't mix well and recommended their premium caipirinha.  We decided to order one of these and the melon flavored one.  They both weren't bad but honestly I didn't think they were amazing.  If you've never had one, give it a shot.  Myself, I think I'll pass on it for the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "We didn't sit long before they told us our table was ready.  We sat down and the 1st thing I noticed was how dimly lit the lights were.  Almost like a strip club, it was a little strange.  I like to clearly see the food I'm eating.  Well, the meat ensemble started in.  16 different meats served tonight.  Admittedly some of the meats is really salty and left me thirsting for water pretty bad afterwards but still pretty outstanding overall.  Some of the meats definitely better than others.  \n",
      "\n",
      "You also get served three sides on the table.  Garlic mashed potatoes, fried banana, and fried yucca I think.  They're pretty outstanding.  The yucca is super crunchy, the potatoes garlicky and the banana really sweet.  The only problem with the sides is that you're so focused on eating the meats, the sides tend to get cold and definitely just don't taste as good.\n",
      "\n",
      "So this is really the start of the beginning for me.  I think I've finally hit the wall.  I'm 39 years old now and my body's really starting to fight me back.  What do I mean?  I ate a ton of food that night and a massive amount of meat.  I thought I was going to die from meat ****POISONING****.  That meat really stuck hard in my mid-section (stomach?) and was crazy heavy the rest of the night.  I honestly just don't think I can do this anymore.  Just done with eating soooooooooooooo much meat.  Yep, I've over the hill.  Sigh.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, what's the solution?  Why even mention all this?  Because if you're not a carnivore and get invited to come eat here, you can order just the salad bar for $20.  It's a great deal.  If I lived/worked close by, I would probably do this at least 1/month.  Maybe even for lunch.  The salad bar is awesome.  Something like 30+ selections on the bar.  Bar is like 20 feet long and different selections on both sides.  Really outstanding selections of food and all really good.  There was even a plate of just fried bacon!  Was salad topping.  Kinda crazy, I almost wanted to grab the entire plate it looked so good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally for dessert we ordere the papaya cream and the flan.  The flan was outstanding.  Flan is usually too dense or too drippy and really hard to balance the two to make the perfect flan.  This was it.  Really just perfect.  Amazing.  The papaya cream?  Wow, it's almost like eating ice cream except it's not.  It's pretty awesome.  Definitely give it a try.\n",
      "\n",
      "So finally at the end, for the two of us, about $150.  Oh, and they give military discounts!  So I paid less than that.  Though they actually messed up my discount.  It's suppose to be 10% off and my bill went from $152 to $147.  Oh well.  \n",
      "\n",
      "So if you still haven't tried a churrascaria yet and you live in Vegas, you've now two outstanding choices to choose from.  Here or Texas de Brazil.\n",

      "I would like to deeply apologize for not listening to those of you who forewarned me about going to Texas De Brazil for my four year anniversary. I almost wish I just ended up going to Olive Garden instead. But, I should have listened to Debbie and gone to Rosemary's. But, the 25% coupon was just too hard to pass up and so made my decision that way. \n",
      "\n",
      "I made reservations for 7:45pm and was really excited about it because of all the hype that was given about the restaurant. My friends love it here, my ex-boss love it here, and most yelp reviewers are fond of this place. When we arrived, we gave them my name with the expectation of being seated immediately since we had a reservation. But, that wasn't the case. We were given one of those gadgets that light up when you're ready to be seated and was told it would be a few minutes. That was unusual for my boyfriend and myself. \n",
      "\n",
      "About 20 minutes had passed and we finally got seated. First of all, what is the point of having a reservation if we're not going to be seated at our reservation time? This isn't the doctors office. When we sat down, we didn't know exactly what to do until a few minutes later when our server came to bring us bread. She said we just get up to get food from the salad bar and when we're ready we turn the circle cardboard thing over to green to let the guys with meat know that we're ready for meat. If we wanted a break, we turn it back to red. It was interesting but definitely not impressive. Secondly, do we get our own plate or does someone bring us any plates for the meat? I had to ask a server how that worked. \n",
      "\n",
      "We got up to get food from the salad bar and found a whole a variety of different salads to choose from. It was definitely a different kind of salad bar and excitement came over me after seeing it. I chose little bits of everything so I can get a taste of it all. There was a red salad with cranberry that tasted decent, mushrooms with garlic was okay, cucumber salad was nothing exciting, sushi sucked, smoked salmon was really good, cheese and meat weren't impressive to me, etc. My boyfriend wasn't happy either. He said he's had better. Needless to say, our excitement dropped by a half. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was time for us to try the meat, and after turning the circle card over to green, a whole band of guys with meat kept coming to us with what they had in their skewers. The chicken wrapped in bacon wasn't anything special. The chicken wasn't moist enough; chicken with Parmesan was too salty; steak was really good and had enough flavor; lamb tasted like fish and was nasty! Don't get that unless you like the taste of old rotten fish; prime rib was also very tasty. \n",
      "\n",
      "After a few bites of the meat, we were just done. Twenty minutes of eating their food was more than enough and just called it quits. I think the only way we can enjoy the atmosphere there is if we were with a bunch of other people with a lot of alcohol in our system. To the right of us was a table with women cackling the whole time we were there. Not attractive to see and hear a woman cackle. So, Debbie definitely understand now why you went against the idea. \n",
      "\n",
      "We got our check and I presented her the 25% coupon we had and she had the nerve to educate me on letting someone know ahead of time that we had the coupon. Funny thing is when I made the reservations on line, there was a place where you can make comments and I made the comment that we had a coupon for 25%. I even called to make sure they knew about that. What amazed me above all else is how the server didn't even ask us how we enjoyed our food. It was prominent that we hated it there by just looking at our dull sullen faces. I could've raised a stink that the amount of money we paid was not worth the food they gave us. My bf and I wondered if our pallets are just not meant for expensive food. \n",

      "\n",
      "Carnevino Restaurant\n",
      "Richard Douglas/General Manager\n",
      "\n",
      "Dear Mr. Douglas,\n",
      "\n",
      "My fiance and I decided to try Carnevino because one, I love Mario Batali and two, we enjoy trying new places.  It was also his 39th birthday and I decided to take him somewhere fancy.  I wanted to express my sentiments in writing so that you may get a full understanding of our dining experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "First off, the bar service was awesome.  I had one Greyhound and I was tipsy.  Thankfully, the bartender gave me a great drink for a great price of $15.  If you want a better variety of patrons, you may consider dropping some of your drink prices.  Las Vegas being a tourist town, it's hard to enjoy a drink if you are paying through the nose.  Not to mention, it's not like he used Grey Goose, Russo-Baltique, Belvedere or Oval.  He used Kettle One. Sorry, that's not a $15 drink.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were excited to try the food since I reviewed the menu prior to making the reservation.  I already knew that we would not be eating steak even though Carnevino is a \"Steak House\" type restaurant simply because I refuse to pay $72 per person just for rib-eye, when I can get a great steak at Maggiano's for a much reasonable price.  Plus, my guy and I are not big meat eaters.  Before I get to the food aspect of my letter, I wanted to talk about your staff.  We had two waiters:  Marco and Danielle.  We loved Danielle.  She was the type of person you could have sitting at your table like she was an old friend.  Her energy and knowledge of food preparation and description of items was awesome.  I felt like we belonged there and she made us feel very welcomed.  Then, there was Marco.  Marco reminded me of those European waiters who has been serving people in fine restaurants for probably over 15 years.  He personally made me feel like I was not good enough to eat at your restaurant.  It's a feeling I have experienced before and it certainly is very disappointing especially when I knew that our dinner would be pricey.  I expected better service and frankly, my fiance felt the same way.  If it weren't for Danielle, we would have left upon being seated.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a starter we ordered the fried calamari which was amazing.  I also loved the bread and topping options.  I am a little bit of a risk taker, more so than my fiance and I decided on trying the Roasted Quail.  We enjoyed our vegetable selection of Italian broccoli with roast pork,  fried eggplant and the best mashed potatoes we have ever had.  Now comes the fun part: the bird.  The quail smelled like wet dog and I tried it, just once.  I was polite and asked Danielle to remove it from my table because it actually made me nauseaous.  I am sure that it was cooked the way it should be but the reality is, not everyone has the same palate.  Chef's take the kind of thing personally so I assured the manager and everyone else that it was nothing the chef did.  I simply did not want it.  If it was New York pigeon, I would have guessed that instead.  The manager was kind enough to bring me something else even though I was fine with paying for my quail.  We weren't looking for a free meal. \n",
      "\n",
      "I like it when wait-staff come to your table to check on you but Marco coming to our table a total of 9 times in 10 minutes was not needed.  It was as though he was checking to make sure that we had not left without paying.  Maybe the fact that my fiance and I are heavily tattooed, one might think that we must not have much money.  Afterall, it's not like tattoos are expensive, right?  I must not be employed to be able to wear a BCBG dress, have 70% of my body tattooed and manage to pay a $125 bill without blinking. My mistake.\n",
      "\n",
      "We won't be returning.  Though we enjoyed the side options of the menu, the food overall was not what we expected.  The atmosphere was nice though you really need to consider a different option for music.  Not everyone likes the Rolling Stones, especially on repeat.  And have a chat with Marco about his demeanor.  Though I am sure because of his many years of experience as a waiter, he must assume that this equates the same for how you treat people.  I could stoop down to his level and say something like, \"Afterall, he is only just a waiter\" but then again, I am above that.  I respect people and respect what people do for a living.  Maybe one day, he will have a waiter quite like himself and remember that he serves the public, much like a janitor. \n",

      "We munched on warm tortilla chips with two small containers of salsa and guacamole (courtesy of your restaurant) while we waited for our food. My nachos came out first and I thought they were going to be topped with the kimchi but they were not. Instead, I received my kimchi about 5 minutes later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's talk about your bulgolgi nachos for a bit. They LOOK good. However, upon dissection all it is a HUGE plate of chips with skimpy toppings. The toppings there do equate to good flavor and a yummy taste but the ratio of chips to meat and cheese is lacking. I was slightly pissed off because of the lack of bulgolgi on my nachos. It was like it was sprinkled on quickly as an after thought. If I am paying $6.00 for a half order of nachos, I expect just a little bit more. Why not layer your nachos so that you get yummy toppings throughout? Because after you eat the top layer, you are left with plain ole tortilla chips. How fun or good is that? Think about it, okay?\n",
      "\n",
      "Kim chi. Is it jarred? And why is it chopped up so little? And kimchi should have some spicy heatness to it. This kimchi lacked in serious flavor. I swear it is jarred and I am thinking you might be able to get more flavor profile if you make your own. Think about it, okay?\n",
      "\n",
      "The fusion calamari taco. It wasn't bad. I don't have much to pick on about it. I ate it all. However, I don't know what I expected in my head but fusion just made me think it would be so different. It was just two long pieces of deep fried calamari on a flour tortilla with some lettuce and toppings and fusion tartar sauce. I LIKED it, but didn't LOVE it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bulgogi  Fried Rice. You win in portion amount. Hands down. It is big just like the nachos. But when the first word is Bulgolgi, I expect more bulgolgi. I should have caught on when the waitress kept correcting me and calling it beef. I just thought she was being rude and didn't like the way I was saying it. The flavor profile in this fried rice is decent. I am a self proclaimed fried rice snob and I can honestly say I didn't have to add anything to it to make it taste better. I just needed more meat. I would gladly receive a smaller portion to get a bulgolgi fried rice. Think about it okay?\n",

I skipped the fries, which didn't look all that great on hubby's plate and there was the tiniest container of coleslaw ever as a side that was actually pretty good.

Do they make them there, have them delivered, can't they walk over to the Teet and get some cupcakes and pass them off as their own? I would have enjoyed them either way but still the whole notion of no cupcakes threw me off and I don't think our server liked me asking why they were out b/c he started to get a little snippy right after that.

The cream cheeses were also good and I really enjoyed these particular flavors. I did try a bit of the Garlic Cheddar and that one good, though I preferred the other two. The Nova and Lox were great, however, the Whitefish was not as smokey or tender as I'd like. Not a big loss for me since I'm more concerned about the salmon anyway. Lastly, I loved all the fixings!

Exceptions: their take on a meat-stuffed eggroll, and, believe it or not, the gyros.  Also well-spiced: a variety of sauces which helps offset the blandness of the food.  I must also comment on the tabouleh (which here means ground parsley) served as a huge mound on most plates; it would feed a baseball team, but it, too, is tasteless.

While waiting we indulged in some oyster shots and conversation with the chef, and then finally! The pan roast was served! Creamy, flavorful and enormous portion. I ordered ****COMBINATION**** Pan Roast with shrimp, crab, and lobster. I don't know why I waited sooo long to try it! oh I know why, the never ending wait.

      "\n",
      "Whenever I come here, I get one of 3 options.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Pho (Beef Noodle Soup). I get the rare steak, flank, and brisket option. If you dont want your broth as greasy, minus the brisket. Just your basic pho with nothing but meat. No tendons or tripe. This would be a good choice for you first timers that dont wanna second guess what's in your soup. For you adventurers and seasoned vets, the combination has everything in it. Don't forget about the bean sprouts, cilantro, mint leaves, and sliced jalapenos that come on a separate plate for you to throw in there at your discretion.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Rice Vermicelli. I usually get the Charbroiled Beef or Pork with Egg rolls and Vegetables. I get this because it comes with the crispy egg rolls that they make so good. So instead of ordering it as a side item, it already comes with it. They give you a small cup of sweet n sour fish sauce to mix in your bowl for that complete flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Rice Dish. I get the Diced Beef with Grilled Onions accompanied by Tomato Fried Rice. Very tender cuts of sirloin pan fried in oil and soy sauce. Very flavorful.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have also have tried their Seafood Barbeque ****COMBINATION****. When you order this they bring out a portable grill heated by a specific gel. On a separate plate they give you raw shrimp, beef, squid, and tripe. You cook these items yourself. So basically, this is their version of Korean Barbeque. It's pretty much guaranteed this is what you will be smelling when you walk in there. This is what parties of 3 or more usually get because for about 25 bucks you get a decent amount of food.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last but not least, I have heard great things about their Beef Salad. Eventually I will get it and it will probably be my fourth option.\n",
      "\n",
      "These guys are open until about 3 am 7 days a week 365 days a year. I know this because Christmas Day nobody wanted to cook so we went here. Their service is very efficient and they always seem to be fully staffed every time I go.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only negative thing that brings them to 4 instead of 5 stars is that the floor always seems to be littered with misc things. Not to the point where its piled up but if you look hard enough, you will see it. I will give them a pass because everything else makes up for it. Any questions? Message me and I will tell you everything I know! \n",

      "\n",
      "2. Order from the Poke Express section complete with all your poke needs from Ahi, Salmon, Shrimp, Special combinations, and even cucumber kim chi for your veggie requirements.  My favorites are the Special ****COMBINATION**** poke, and the Furikake poke.  The raw fish is fresh, and you can order by the 1/2 pound.  This gets pretty pricey though, and you can get pretty full if you just order a 1/2 pound of poke and maybe a 1/2 pound of cucumber kim chi.  Good for the no carb dieters!\n",

Quite a complete meal that we shared it among 2 people and still could not eat all of it. The Baby Back Ribs were super tender and moist and as a cut each rib, the meat would just fall off the bone. The Catfish was good, would have been nice with some tarter sauce. The sides were average, not great, but not bad. The baked potato was loaded with butter, sour cream, chives and Bacon so that was a winner, the mac and cheese was good but when the waitress said that is their recommendation and the best side, I expected a little more. The Roasted Corn when we ordered expected a ear of corn roasted over a grill, but what we received was an inch of 2 ends of corn on the cob and loose corn kernels in a small bowl which could have been corn from a can.\n",

It sounded so strange, but everything looked so good. Optimize your stop here and get the bowl with 2 items. You can leave the meat in the bowl as is or put it in one of their other options (quesadilla or burrito). My choice was the Chinese BBQ Pork (my favorite of the 2 items, which I left as just the meat) and the Hengrenade Chicken (because it is milder than the Jerk Chicken option) in a quesadilla. Everything came out hot and fresh, the meat was tender and flavorful. And the Snickerdoodle Cookies. AH THE COOKIES. You must get a cookie. Do it.

Instead, look for pomodoro sauce and bruschetta.   Don't let its off-Strip location fool you into thinking it's a hole-in-the-wall establishment, either.

It was refreshing and light and I like the sweet vinaigrette they used.  As for the ****COMBINATION**** Platter, it was a good size and I was hamming on those cheddar cubes.  I love cheese.

I ended up eating a slice of a small The Malnati Chicago Classic and a few bites off a slice of The \"Lou.\"  I really liked The Malnati Chicago Classic.  It had good flavor and the Lou's lean sausage wasn't greasy at all.  The \"Lou\" was a bit too salty and almost-too-indulgently cheesy.  Cheese drag action left and right, yo.

We ordered our drinks and some appetizers (alligator, and boudin) , then browsed the menu for a bit.  I had an idea of what I was going to get, but there were SO MANY delicious sounding items, it was hard to pick.  I made up my mind though and placed my order for the lunch sized portion of the crawfish combination.  While waiting for our food, our waitress delivered a loaf of French bread and some butter.  Here is how everything was...............\n",
      "\n",
      "Alligator-  I had only had alligator once before (Dragos in New Orleans), and thought it was delicious.  Somewhat of a chicken texture, but a tad more chewy.  When we went to order the alligator appetizer, our waitress informed us that there was an option for it to be grilled, also (the menu only offers the fried option).  We decided to go with a large order and went half grilled, half fried.  It was a damn fine recommendation by our waitress.  The fried portion was crispy and chewy and had great flavor.  The star of the show though, was the grilled!  It was blackened in a great seasoning, and had great texture.  It comes with some \"alligator sauce\", and a few dips into that, put my mouth in heaven!  Both my buddy and I liked the grilled a little more than the fried.  Both choices were freaking delicious though!  Can't go wrong with either option!\n",
      "\n",
      "Boudin- Boudin is a Cajun sausage stuffed with a dirty rice type mixture.  This appetizer came with 2 links on top of a pile of rice.  The casings that they use and pretty strong and somewhat hard to cut.  I pretty much split mine down the middle and just ate the \"guts\" of the sausage.  It definitely had a different texture/taste.  Reminded me of a \"white hot\", almost.  It was tasty, but not sure if I would crave it or get it again.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Crawfish ****COMBINATION****-  This was my entree, and it was damn tasty!  This mountain of a plate came with a massive pile of dirty rice topped with crawfish etouffee, and a massive pile of fried crawfish.  This entree should be split by 2 people.  One man should not try to tackle this thing on its own.  And this was a \"lunch\" portion.  Can't even imagine how big the \"dinner\" portion is.  The fried crawfish were breaded and seasoned perfectly!  I kept popping nugget, after nugget into my mouth and could not stop eating them!  The etouffee part of the entree was delicious as well!  It was a thick gravy filled with tons of pieces of crawfish, layered over dirty rice.  I am not the biggest rice fan, but this rice was awesome!  I ate until I could not eat anymore, and there was still about half of the etouffee left.  Got it boxed up and gave it to a homeless lady on our drive home.\n",
      "\n",
      "My buddy went with the Cajun Combo (catfish and shrimp Creole).  He let me try some of his blackened catfish (biggest filet of catfish I have ever seen!) and it was delicious!  The shrimp creole was a bit skimp though.  It was mainly veggies and very few shrimp.  Total opposite of my crawfish etouffee (overflowing with crawfish).\n",
      "\n",
      "After we gorged ourselves silly, we still went with some dessert.  My buddy loves key lime pie, so we went with a slice of that.  Holy hell!  Delicious!  HUGE piece of key lime pie.  Great graham cracker crust, perfectly chilled filling and it was topped with berries and puree etc.  It was a great piece of pie!  (It was comped off the bill, too.  Read other reviews of people getting a free dessert if it is your first time dining here...not sure if that is true or not, but it makes sense.  And, that is freaking awesome if that is why!)\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, it was a great lunch!  Pricey, yes, but that french bread, alligator, boudin, crawfish combination and key lime pie were all fantastic!  Pair that with great service, great company, and an awesome setting (the restaurant is beautiful!), it justifies the price, somewhat.  Can't eat here every day, but for special occasions or a few times a year, this may be my new \"go to spot\" in Phoenix.  It wasn't just the best meal of the weekend, it may have been one of the best meals I have had since being in Phoenix!  It was awesome and I can't wait to go back!\n",

How could it not be? Try to get here relatively early though, because some items like the brisket run out later in the evening. While it's a bummer, think of it as a good thing.

      "The downhill slide started when local politicians cracked down on the street \"performers --\" an asylum's-worth of scabrous ex-cons and pustulant opioid addicts who used to run amok in filthy costumes, often harassing and threatening passers-by. These days, performers have to get a license, and are geographically constrained into little hopscotch circles for one-hour periods. Damn gov'ment, always ruining the fun!! These regulations drove out all the really interesting (i.e. repulsive) characters, and what you're left with now is a gaggle of cellulitey \"showgirls,\" an angry, pathetic XXX Mr. T...and that stupid horrible XXXXXX sax man who plays in the bed of a pickup truck, and whose \"music\" is akin to having your eardrums sliced by jagged radioactive toenail clippings.\n",

The egg on my meal was dry and tasteless. They could have cooked it in the microwave because that is sure what it tasted like. The fried chicken was hard and dry as well. No seasoning to be found. \n",

So why in the heck is Hash House using thick cut, hearty bread on a kids grilled cheese i have no idea why. NOT KID FRIENDLY. So i asked the server if we could replace the fresh fruit that came with the grilled cheese with french fries. The answer was no and if I wanted fries, i would pay additional. Fine, whatever. I got to feed my son.\n",

But I would forgive them, if the food was actually fantastic. I can quickly recommend the Yard House and Cheesecake Factory for having better asian lettuce wraps - They have better portions, tastier meats and extremely complex and flavorful sauces in their versions. The sauces here were very simple - Peanut, sweet and sour, sweet soy. If I could tell each ingredient immediately right off the bat, that makes for an amateur sauce, if you ask me (the sauce queen.) The chicken sate skewers tasted identical to the Thai and Chinese restaurants in the mall's food court that offer you samples on toothpicks. Yeah it's moist, but it also lacks the finesse and flavor that you would come to expect from the Mayor of Flavortown. The Chinese minced chicken was beyond salt bombed. That's all we tasted, salt. It's funny to me that the idea of \"Asian\" inspired is to douse everything with soy sauce. Lol. Hey, there's more to asian flavors than just salty soy sauce. \n",

      "We also shared the \"Big Dipper Sandwich\" ($17) - The roast beef was bland, chewy, hard and dry. The fries were dried out and rock hard - they've been sitting on a heating rack, that's for sure. It's upsetting that they couldn't even manage to dish out freshly fried-to-order fries. The bread roll was hard and plain - where's the toasted garlic torpedo roll that was advertised? Definitely didn't taste any garlic. I also didn't taste the creamy horseradish sauce and the au jus?! Ha. Let's just say it tasted like worcestershire sauce and water. I dunked my sandwich and I didn't taste any richness, any soul, any flavor! I see a rosemary garnish but no rosemary flavor? Weird. The lovely (random) ladies next to us from Pennsylvania ordered the same and they were highly disappointed as well. They said it was \"very dry.\" \n",

First and foremost, service was extremely spotty.   We were initially seated at a table, immediately told to move as there could be no table there as it was blocking the doors onto the balcony.   We were moved to a table nearby only to see that a new larger table of 6 was dressed exactly in the same spot some 15 minutes later.   Perhaps they didn't want to sacrifice such \"prime\" real estate on a 2-top, but we certainly felt s****LIGHTED**** to say the least.   For the remainder of the meal, it was evident the servers were much more interested in lavishing attention on larger parties.   We asked twice for water refill while our glasses remained empty.   Sorry, but that just doesn't fly.\n",

Gordon Ramsay BurGR, then, is obviously pretty low on his list of giving-a-damn-ness, given that he has not one but TWO references to himself in the name. There's also the tacky menu cover, which is just a giant picture of himself posing like he's a de****LIGHTED**** gay man opening up his first superbly-well-endowed package. This place is total crap. The burgers are crap. The fries are boring (and are crap). The ketchup tries way too hard (and is crap). The beers were warm (and crap). The atmosphere is a cleaner version of a fast-food joint.

Menu looks great, lots of options for everyone so we're off to a good start.  Ordered the Caesar Salad to start and Sweetie had the \"Bibb Salad\".  Salads were OK, nothing great...but hey, it's a salad.  The Parm roll served with my Caesar was \"old\" and the croutons were unseasoned.\n",

My entree was almost NON EXISTENT, I ordered the hangar steak, which was barely 2 slices of steak on top of a \"sweet potato hash\".  I was completely disappointed in the portion size and when I said something to the manager he tried to convince me that t was 8 Oz. of steak before cooking.  Now, let me say that I was a butcher in a former life (really) and know my meat....I'm not sure if someone hasn't checked their scales, but this portion was never 8 Oz!  For $18.00, I was VERY disappointed in the value of the entree.  Now, the steak, what there was of it was tasty and the sweet potato hash was also good.  I just have to be honest the only thing I could think about was the small portion sixe the whole meal which ruined it.\n",

      "\n",
      "First off, for a place that's so committed to sustainability and eco-consciousness, the vegetarian and vegan options are ridiculous.  There was exactly one truly vegetarian entree on the menu, and that, the waiter said, was \"basically a wrap,\" one of the most boring meal combinations on the planet.  The rest of the menu was meat or meat-based.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I get that Cleveland is a meat-lovers town, I really do.  But for a place that strives to be veg-friendly -- at least I assumed it did -- it's disappointing that only one vegetarian (not vegan) entree was available. (My waiter said as much.) Strangely, there is a little vegetarian symbol next to some foods but some of them have meat. The PBT, for example, has bacon in its name! Why flag something as being vegetarian when it's not? \n",
      "\n",
      "What I did order could not have been more confusing and unappealing.  The PBT (minus the bacon) consisted of a grilled sandwich the size of the palm of my hand with a huge schmear of pimento and goat cheese inside.  It was rich, and tasty, but also tiny.  The other two-third of the plate consisted of a gigantic mound of mini-shoestring potatoes and a huge serving of tomato coulis, which I guess I was supposed to dip my sandwich into (see my photo).  A tiny sandwich, a mound of cast-off potato pieces and what basically amounts to tomato soup, not even served with a spoon?  I just don't get it. The proportions were off.  The flavors were OK but also proportionately strange. The whole thing just didn't make sense. (My two guests had burgers, which they said were fine.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The lighting was also off. We were sitting in an area that was well ****LIGHTED****. But the folks behind us were in almost total darkness.  Another strange sighting? Tablecloths on some tables but not others.\n",
      "\n",
      "The waiter was nice but had no idea how to handle our complaints.  When we said the food was \"just OK,\" he said \"Oh ok\" and walked away quietly.  The correct reply is \"What can I do to make it better?\" He seemed untrained on how to react to unhappy patrons.  The eager busboy didn't help either; he whisked away a glass of soda without asking. I wasn't done with it.  That I had to ask for the bill twice didn't end the meal on a pleasant note.\n",

      "I'm sad that I have to write this review. I really had high hopes for this place. I brought two people with me who I wanted to impress, after the great experience I had two years ago.  But after this meal, I'm unlikely to return.  I don't care if the walls are made of old barn; if you can't offer truly sustainable food -- vegetarian and vegan included -- and your staff has no idea how to make things better when people are not happy, then I'm not your customer.\n",

They do offer veggie friendly entrees, but it is by no means a vegetarian establishment. They LOVE their sausages and bacon! I wanted to try something Southern, so I tried the grits and biscuits (thinking they are their signature items). Coming from the West, grits are very foreign to me. Their grits were thick and tasted like they were made with sour cream. I was not a fan. When I think biscuits, I think \"plain, nothing fancy.\" Their biscuits have crystallized sugar on top. I know I high****LIGHTED**** two items, but we ordered more.

The sticky toffee pudding was served with sweet cream gelato, which was creamy and refreshing.\n",

Not overpowering, but very distinctly present.  This is more like the Rudy's I knew a year or more ago.  I'd say today was a 4-star meal, but I won't give them that for two reasons.  First, inconsistency.  Six months ago their meat had no smoke flavor at all.  Six months before that it did, and today it did.  I'd like more consistency and reliability in the quality of the meal.  And second, there was a coal in my green chili stew.  They tried to say it was just a \"burnt end\".  No, it was a piece of burned wood.  I know the difference.

The only thing that was really good was the fresh lamb/beef gyros, which were carved straight off the rotating, vertical spit.  Unfortunately, the meat was ready only every 10-15 minutes (an eternity at a buffet) and there wasn't much of it each time they carved it.  You had to be fast, or the meat would run out.  Extra points for having mini-pitas and a full bar of condiments, such as sliced tomatoes, lettuce, tzatziki, and crumbled feta cheese.  I also appreciated their sushi bar, which had tuna poke and tuna sashimi, which was fresh and very good.    \n",
      "\n",
      "Bellagio's carving station offered a large variety of meats, from the standard prime rib and lamb to more \"exotic\" fare, such as bison and beef wellington, which later turned into chicken wellington.  I tried the prime rib, the bison, and the beef wellington, all of which were lacking in flavor.  The prime rib was a tad overdone, even from the center, and the seasoning, which made for a good tasting crust, didn't penetrate to the center of the meat.  The bison and beef wellington were both tough and over-cooked.  It was my first time trying bison and while I think it had potential, it was just too tough for me to enjoy.  Likewise, the beef wellington, which had a good pastry crust, was too dry.\n",

The creme brulee, which I had 3 of (yes, I know, I'm a pig), came with a perfectly crisp, carmelized crust, which I de****LIGHTED**** in cracking with my spoon.  Delicious.  Next up was a key lime pie - it was deliciously tart and smooth.  Likewise, the lemon meringue pie was amazing, with a nicely browned meringue on top.  There were other desserts as well, all of which were good, presumably because the man behind Jean Philippe Patisserie is overseeing all the desserts at the Bellagio.\n",

If you can eat $35+ worth of pastries and perhaps nibbles of sushi, gyro, cocktail shrimp, and pasta, then Bellagio is the place to go.

The tots themselves were well cooked and lightly crispy. I liked the kick of heat from the jalapeno juxtaposed with the sweetness of the marmelade. I found that the tots became too salty for my tastes the more I ate them though. The same could really be said for the pretzels and pork. Everything was way too salty for me. As for the pretzels, they are served with beer cheese and the cheese had more of a chopped curd/cottage cheese texture rather than a melted fondue-like texture that I typically see with similar dishes at other restaurants. The green chile pork was probably the best tasting of the three items we got and I enjoyed the thick grilled tortillas they came with. It was initially was very watery though and hard to eat with the tortillas without chile-pork juice dribbling all over me as I ate it. \n",

Our table was directly under a tree which provided some nice shade but also became a bird bomb site as some sparrows and doves decided to roost above us towards the end of our meal. We had a close call or two! \n",

The food is good...A-OK is actually very apt...but not of the caliber that you'd find in New Orleans.

      "We were in for their Mardi Gras celebration last night, and they were offering a few specials for the occasion, which I took advantage of, as the regular menu is not large, and I've had most everything that I want to try on it already. The duck and oyster gumbo was very good, with tender duck meat as well as delightful cracklins, and whole oysters swimming in a full flavored broth with long grain rice. Thumbs up on the gumbo. I was de****LIGHTED**** to see crawfish etouffee as a special, as this really belongs on the regular menu of any Creole restaurant. When you get this meal anywhere in New Orleans (I know, I know...I keep harping on the whole New Orleans thing. But this place is claiming that badge, so I feel justified in making the comparison), it comes as a kind of saucy stew served over long grain white rice. Maybe a sprinkle of parsley. The chef here served it over puff pastry with asparagus and house cured tasso. When I saw that description, my heart sank a little, but I ordered it anyway. I understand that he was trying to dress up the dish a little, as people outside of Louisiana might not think the simplicity of this dish warrants a $24 price tag. If I base my review on just the etouffee alone, it was not very good. Not enough creamy sauce, not enough flavor. The addition of the puff pastry and aspargus pulled it down more. The puff pastry was just in the way, and the asparagus, while perfectly cooked, did not belong with the other elements on the plate. The house made tasso lacked depth of flavor, and seemed like just strips of ham that they had put some dry rub on and aged. This whole dish needs work. We skipped dessert last night as we had 2 on our last visit, and they were both disappointing. The NOLA cocktail, which is bourbon, simple syrup, absinthe and lemon juice, had not enough bourbon flavor and too much lemon. I also need to mention service. We had three servers come to our table and say the EXACT SAME THING. One would greet us, let us know that they and another two servers would be taking care of us, ask us if we'd been here before, and get a drink order. By the third time it was beyond annoying, and my vocal partner let them know. I've said it before...team service needs to be three different people doing different tasks, so the customer isn't burdened with repetition.

      "For my meal I opted for Cedar Grilled Yellowtail with Potatoes while my buddy selected Filet Oscar.  While both presentations were relatively simple, the plating was attractive, the food was very fresh, and portions were adequate for the prices.  For a side we split Lobster Mac n' Cheese that was incredibly creamy and cheesy, yet with enough lobster that it wasn't overwhelmed.  Definitely the highlight before dessert arrived.\n",

Served with a caramel cookie and marscapone icecream I'd say this was one of the 5 best Bread puddings I've tasted, though nowhere near the one at Emeril's Orlando location.  My friend choose a flourless chocolate cake with a Godiva liquor milkshake that, although small, was enjoyed greatly by my friend.\n",

      "All told, I've certainly had better meals, but the place was above average 'dinner out.'

The bartender and whoever else were working there must be busy, because no one acknowledge my presence at all.  Total fail on my part, especially after I had completed a session on How To Make An entrance at a work related workshop.   Not to be deterred by having been s****LIGHTED**** by these employees, I brazing set off to explore the depth of this unwelcoming alcoholic dispensary.

      "Blog for full review of food - as this was a comped return visit I hig****LIGHTED**** the service issues here.\n",
      "\n",
      "As previously stated, after complaining to the GM (at that time a Mr. Jason Bartucci) with hopes that future visitors would not deal with such service we were provided a profound apology and an offer to refund the cost or to come back for a compensatory meal on the house - at the time I declined these options but on further review, a year after many fine dining experiences, I reconsidered.  In a city with so many great options I would not generally be the sort to 'forgive and forget,' but returning with my two friends - both who love steak - and remembering how good the food was I made contact with the restaurant through the MGM website.  While Mr. Bartucci (and our server) had apparently since been dismissed from the restaurant, my e-mail was answered by the new General Manager, Sebastien Vallet, who invited the three of us back for the chef's tasting with wine pairings on the house. \n",
      "\n",
      "Taking our seats we were almost instantly met by Mr. Vallet, a gregarious and friendly man in a great looking grey suit (vastly differing from the black/white clad servers,) who promised us a fantastic meal and confirmed that I did not eat beef while my friends most certainly did.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Within moments our waters were filled - bottled water without even requesting, and our server and his assistant came to our table to once again confirm likes, dislikes, and anything we may need.  In order to not belabor service issues too much I will note a couple of issues here that, despite their obviously being overly attentive to our table, were less than impressive.  First, while Sebastien stopped by multiple times, our server spent vastly more time at a table of well clad businessmen while the assistant served as our primary server throughout.  While not \"unfriendly\" our assistant's grasp of the English language was poor at best, wines were not described as presented, and this was officially the only restaurant on my trip to Vegas where I had to fill my own water.  Another service issue presented itself later, but otherwise I have to say the team clearly \"went out of their way\" to please us - yet despite that fact, the service at Mastro's, CUT, Carnevino, and myriad other fine dining establishments vastly outpaced Craftsteak - their \"average\" being better than Craftsteak's \"best.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Browsing around the restaurant I was amazed at how many hockey jerseys were present - clearly not the \"business casual\" Craftsteak desires.  Arriving from our assistant server without any description (approximately 1 minute later our main server showed up to tell us what the dishes were) our mains and sides were served with a red wine of which I'm unfamiliar and neither myself nor JT enjoyed - Brad thought it was decent.  Featuring mains of a 16oz Ribeye, a 12oz Skirt, and Divers Scallops with Fennel and sides of Yukon Gold Potatoes, Sweet Corn, and Wood Roasted Asparagus this is where the other service issue came up.  As previously noted, I don't eat steak - that doesn't mean my buddies do not eat scallops.  Featuring only five scallops (we received three of the exact same dish as an appetizer last visit) and my friends each deserving to try at least one I explained to our server that this wasn't acceptable and, surprisingly, met some resistance - apparently my thin frame made him think I can't eat.  Asking if any other fishes were available I was told only tuna - again the same prep I'd had last year (there was lobster, I saw it on another table, but clearly they weren't giving this away) and inquiring about birds or pork I was told only chicken (I know they had duck and pork loin, I saw the nightly menu) so I requested the chicken.  Consenting, begrudgingly, the server asked if we wanted anything else and I emphatically stated some mushrooms would be nice.  While it took about 15 minutes to prepare, the dishes were indeed brought by yet another server - someone who actually smiled (aside from Sebastien.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Myself - I was pleased with the food again, but still less than sold on the service given the fact that they were clearly \"doing their best\" and still seemed a little less than in-step with other restaurants of their caliber.  When it was all said and done Mr. Vallet stopped by to see how everything had been and I told him it was good - because it was.  It simply wasn't \"great.\"  Leaving a nice tip for our service team (perhaps had they known we'd be leaving a good tip the primary server would've been more available) we made our way out of Craftsteak for the last time.  Impressed enough that I plan to check out Craft the next time I'm in Los Angeles or NYC, Vegas has plenty of other options in the meats market and if I were attending repeats I'd head to CUT or Carnevino first.\n",

      "It was my boyfriend's birthday and we usually frequent TDB, but this year he wanted to try something different. I made reservations for 4 on Fogo's website about a month in advance, but the day of we needed to make a change and they quickly accommodated us with no problems. We arrived promptly for our reservation at 7pm and were seated right away. After our server took our drink orders we started with the salad bar which consisted of different cold meats and cheeses, a few cold salads, 2 soups and a few hot sides. I didn't particularly care for many items on the salad bar, and it was on the smaller side. DO NOT fill up on the salad bar, this is what they want you to do. Save room for all the yummy meats.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we were ready for meats, we flipped our cards to green and the meat extravaganza began. I had some really delicious cuts of meat including garlic steak, flank steak, top sirloin, bacon wrapped filet and even beef ribs. I also tried parmesan chicken, chicken leg, sausage and pork chops. Everything I tried was very tasty. My favorites were the chicken leg, which had delicious crispy skin on the outside, and the flank steak. MMMM good. As if the meats and salad bar weren't enough food, they also bring 3 side items to your table; mashed potatoes, fried bananas and polenta fries. All carbs, again they are trying to fill you up. The polenta fries were bland and flavorless, skip these if you can, the mashed potatoes were good and the fried bananas were just okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt at times I was bombarded by the Gauchos (the men that bring the meat to your table) and at times there was no one to be found. We had a few different servers checking on us at any given time, one lady in particular while nice was SO ANNOYING. She kept coming by every 2 minutes to ask if we were done with the mashed potatoes, or if she could clear our plates that still had food on them! I understand that she has a job to do, but I felt like it was a bit much. Seriously, it was every 2 minutes. She wanted to clear our table SO BAD and I can't understand why. When I am done eating and I need my plate cleared, I will let you know, thanks.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we were finally finished with our dinner, they brought out a piece of cheesecake with a lit candle for my boyfriend. I was de****LIGHTED**** to find that the dessert was complimentary, and thought that was super cool. This place is a bit more expensive than TDB, I found the salad bar to be lackluster, and because that lady was sooo annoying I don't see myself coming back here.\n",

      "Before planning my trip to Vegas I had actually looked pretty thoroughly for somewhere that did an all beef tasting menu, because I figured if anywhere would have one it would be the land of steakhouses and extravagance. My searches yielded no results, and so I made several other dinner plans for this extended weekend trip. I wound up canceling all of those dinner plans because my friends just weren't interested in dining at ex-Michelin starred restaurants, and fortunately wound up stumbling into the beef tasting menu that I had been searching for, here at Carnevino. Sometimes in Vegas you actually do get lucky...although like everything else in this city our last dinner wasn't all it seemed from the surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "Italian and steakhouse might not generally be two genres you expect to sensibly coexist, but I recall one of the better steaks I've ever had coming from a little Italian place in Fort Worth called Nonna Tata (http://www.yelp.com/biz/nonna-tata-fort-worth#hrid:rGS0dYxxgDOEN_H6QeMAig), so when I found out this place was owned by the celebrity chef Mario Batali I had rather high expectations. Overall I thought all of the food was good, and the service was excellent, but I honestly found some of it just a bit uninspired, and maybe that's because the menu hasn't changed at all since Gregg M and Carol W were here more than a year ago, except for a different dessert, which was easily the most forgettable course. Also, considering the prices here ($120 for the tasting) and relatively small portion size per course I would have expected a much higher quality grade of beef to be used.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first course was a Wagyu beef crudo with coriander, saffron, and fennel piled generously in the middle, and was the only course to feature what most people would consider elite farmed beef. The fact that this was about 1 ounce of actual meat, uncooked, per person certainly left me desiring a bit more. Given that, the flavor of the raw beef was outstanding, and the fennel added a delicious pop, although if the saffron was there I didn't notice it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Up next was actually a delicious pasta course, beef cheek ravioli with Aceto's 20 year aged balsamic vinegar drizzled over it, along with a bit of shaved parmesan. This really high****LIGHTED**** the Italian side of the cookery at Carnevino more than any other dish, and both the pasta and meat were done perfectly. The rich flavor from the mature balsamic was an outstanding addition.\n",
      "\n",
      "For our third course we were given the first of a contrasting pair of sliced steaks, this one being wet aged Piemontese beef, served over spinach and garlic and topped with a fried quail egg. For me, this was the superior of the two offerings, due to the moistness of the steak and the additional textural enhancement of the quail egg. Meat and yolk together are really sublime, and this was just a bit more pleasurable to eat.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second steak in the duo was dry aged \"BBL\" beef, drizzled with Bernaise sauce and served with a lobster and potato hash. Firstly, let me address this BBL beef moniker, because I believe it's quite important. This is something they've essentially made up, and claimed that it's better than USDA Prime beef, in addition to being hormone and antiobiotic free. Google BBL beef and all you get are references back to Carnevino...shady. There is nobody verifying the quality of these steaks other than Mario and Joe (Bastianich) supposedly, and you know they're not actually in the kitchen here. How did it taste? It was good, sure, but for this price I want some sort of credibility besides your own word (which again, they aren't in the kitchen doing the work). The lobster and potato hash however was fantastic, and I could easily eat a larger portion of this as an entrée.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I mentioned earlier, dessert was a relatively simple and mostly boring goat's milk panna cotta, with \"market\" berries. I'm guessing the market in Las Vegas never really changes, since no real produce comes from here. This time around it was strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries, and I'm guessing if you come back 3 years from now and in December it will still be the same damn berries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The final verdict? Good food with totally unjustified prices. I think the most reasonable thing we got was the $300 bottle of Quintessa to pair with the steaks. Someone needs to come in and shake this place up a bit, as it currently seems like a shell of a great restaurant looking for some spirit to fill in the rest.\n",

      "\n",
      "Located along the Lake of Dreams, one of Wynn's many waterfalls in this case sprawling back from the Parasol Up / Parasol Down Cocktail Lounge, SW Steakhouse occupies a space below the level of the gaming floor across from Walzog's sister Lakeside Restaurant and although the inward facing façade appears fairly unimpressive the space itself is a formal expanse with plush seating, big tables and subtle lighting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Decried by critics for high prices and the open layout, a sea of beige that admittedly does feel a bit less refined than the heavy woods and high ceilings of Carnevino or the darkened recesses of Jean-Georges Steakhouse, dinner at SW begins with check-in at the hostess podium and if one is lucky enough to have reserved early or rich enough to have negotiated otherwise a seat close to the lake offers a great vantage of both the room and a series of shows beginning at 9pm.\n",

      "Dining with another fan of Duck Liver, his preference for a seared preparation making it mandatory that both styles available that evening be ordered, it would be difficult to decide which version was 'better' as both were quite good, the lack of caramelization on the Steak made less relevant by Pistachio Bread Pudding beneath while the Mousse was creamy and well balanced between sweet and savory, but served with far too little Brioche for spreading or sharing.\n",

Once seated, it took her about ten minutes to come by and take our first order. I'll say only one thing about the service and that it was chilly but businesslike: take order, bring order, clear plates, take order, bring order -no eye contact, no smile, and no re-filling of beverages unless we requested. It is what it is. I can usually warm up any chilly server, but not this one! Might try sitting at the bar next time so as to not be 100% reliant on the server. \n",

      "The menu was indeed very extensive. I'm sure you could visit many multiple times and never duplicate, yet leave full and happily satisfied. Since it was our trial run, I took some tips from previous yelpers... \n",
      "1. Screaming O salad: did not like this - it was like a mayonaise soup. Steer clear if you don't like a heavy-handed dose of the stuff. 90% mayo, coating of thick mayo on top, three thin slices of ahi underneath, and some lettuce swimming in the watery mayo soup at the bottom of the bowl. Now we know...\n",
      "2. The snow white roll and orange blossom roll were FRIKKIN AMAZING. Snow white roll -each individual piece of the roll is ever so slightly grilled, so it has a whisp of a smokey flavor. My little tastebuds were freaking out. Insanely good, and so different! Orange blossom roll was also enjoyably different.\n",
      "3. Red Rock roll - kind of forgettable, but I do remember thinking, \"ugh, more mayonaise?\"\n",
      "4. Rib eye steak - was just ok. \n",
      "5. Now, there's one thing on the menu we discovered this day I would place in the \"EXQUISITE\" category. The bacon wrapped scallop skewer. O. M. G. These tiny little gems come two (ONLY TWO?) to a skewer. Just trust me -you're going to want a few of these. I popped the first one in my mouth, and just had to sit there for a moment-what was this? Sweet, salty, chewy, fluffy... what? I just stared at my pal across the table. No words. Eyeballs scanned the restaurant for next closest waitress/server. \"Yes, another one of these, please?\" I forced my now-stuffed table-mate to try one because they are that good. Crack. Bacon-wrapped-scallop CRACK. \n",

      "We ordered the bluefin tuna (toro), the unagi (cooked in two styles, grilled and with salt and pepper), and the grilled salmon cheek (kama).  From the regular menu, we also got the homemade tofu served in two different ways: cold with green onions and ginger (hiyayakko) and sitting in hot broth after being fried (agedashi).  We also had the grilled pork cheek (kurobuta), a couple of chicken wings, and chicken and egg served over a bowl of rice (oyakodon).  For dessert, the green tea creme brulee.\n",

      "\n",
      "The homemade tofu is reason #2 why I'd come back.  I prefer the agedashi style just because I prefer hot tofu over cold, but both styles were enjoyable.  I particularly liked how flavorful the broth was.\n",
      "\n",
      "The unagi was a total rip-off.  $30 for 6 small, bony pieces.  Grilled was better than S&P but neither were things I'd order again and I strongly suggest that you don't either.\n",

      "The salmon kama was okay but not something I'd order here ever again because almost every good Japanese restaurant in California makes it better and for a cheaper price.  That isn't to say it's terrible, though.  If you've NEVER had salmon kama ever and you can't get it where you're from, it doesn't hurt to try it here.\n",

      "\n",
      "The oyako (which means 'parent' and 'child', referring to the chicken and egg, respectively) is classic Japanese comfort food and I loved it.  Tender chicken pieces nestled in a bowl of warm, soft rice that's gooey from egg yolk made this reason #3 why I'd come back.  For some, this dish is about as special as fried rice, but if you love both as much as I do, I'd recommend getting it!\n",

      "Now let me talk about the sub-par service.  We ordered tea (which, surprise surprise, cost us $) but the waitresses rarely refilled our tea no matter how many times we asked.  And when they did, they'd refill it 1/4th of the way.  The tea, by the way, is roasted green tea and is amazing so I suggest ordering it even if you do end up getting sake or beer.  But know your rights--don't be afraid to ask for more and demand that they refill it!  That's what you're paying for, after all!\n",

When we discovered the discrepancy between the amount listed on the bill and the amount we were charged, she tried to defend herself by saying the restaurant was too dark.

Also, there was a makeup mirror attached to the wall for ease of putting on makeup - it could have been ****LIGHTED**** but it still worked well. ALSO there was a huge tub in the bathroom too...not that I had time to be soaking in the tub, but it was nice to have the option. Flat screen TV was standard. Black out curtains were present and are, of course, a Vegas MUST. Beds were fairly comfy.\n",

But then, when I weighed getting dressed and going to the lobby to get coffee there and then coming back to the room against that $4.50...I totally paid that $4.50. To me, the prices for the items in the mini bar were NOT unreasonable or out of line with buying it in the convenience shop downstairs. So we definitely used it for water and whatnot.\n",

      "Food options are plentiful back on the way to the convention center, but if there's a convention going on you can forget eating there without a long wait. The shopping center attached was just...ok. But Hubert Keller has two restaurants here so that alone is bomb ass. They also have the House of Blues and the Foundation Room for entertainment plus a pretty cool bar in the middle of the casino.

In the distant past, I found the Florida Stone Crab Claws to not be that tasty or worth the work of searching through torn shells to scoop out the meat.  But we were in a stone-crab place, so introducing my son to stone crab claws seemed appropriate.  To make sure that we would have a pleasing appetizer course, I hedged by also ordering a Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail, which I knew would be good.  This time the stone crab meat was an eye-opening experience.  I opted for the large claw variety, one for each of us, and wished I had ordered more as my son and I de****LIGHTED**** in the sweet, fresh taste of our crab meat, while Diane did not.  I sampled her claw meat, which was light brown in color and not very tasty, while mine was snow white and delicious.  So, I now know that Stone Crab claws can vary in taste.  And, one is not enough.  But at over $13 a large claw, this is not for those with a low dining out budget!  The Shrimp Cocktail was fine and meaty, as expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "A bowl of Crab Bisque was up next.  Very good with bits of crunchy garnish, but warm rather than hot.  I appreciated the pitted Black Olives in Joe's Chopped Salad, and liked the Feta Cheese-laced creation, but missed the prosciutto, pancetta, or ham commonly found in Chopped Salads served in Italian restaurants, which I realize Joe's is not.  So, next time I will revert to ordering a Caesar Salad here.  \n",

      "With all of the Surf & Turf combinations I had recently enjoyed on a cruise around South Africa and during the December holidays just past, I took an unusual detour, and swiveled instead to Chopped Steak for my entree, which is prime grade beef, ordered medium.  I should have ordered it medium-rare, because it arrived medium-well.  Yet showered with a carafe of brown au jus, the meaty dish was still quite tasty.  My son loved his Dover Sole, which was deboned tableside (but for 1 small bone), slathered with Buerre Blanc, and an absolutely huge double-sided fish fillet.  And Diane greatly enjoyed her medium-rare filet dipped in Bearnaise Sauce and 10 oz. Lobster Tail dunked in Drawn Butter.  Our server thought that we had ordered enough potato already before I added French Fries to orders of Crispy Hash Brown Potatoes and a Baked Sweet Potato adorned with of all things (Wait for this!) sweet and memorable Praline Pecan Butter.  But crispy Fries just go too well with Chopped Steak to forego.  And, after my son enjoyed a Caesar Salad, we rounded out these sides with tasty Roasted Cauliflower graced by Sage Brown Butter, and a dish of impeccably prepared Sauteed Spinach.  The huge order of slightly crunchy Hash Browns was superior in every sense, and the skin-on Fries fresh and a perfect mate to my Chopped Steak.  The delectable Baked Sweet Potato was just a delightful bonus!  \n",

We were sat at a booth and offered water upon being sat. The waitress came and shared the menu. but only high****LIGHTED**** the blood orange margarita drink. She didn't ask what we liked or typically drink to get a recommendations and I'm not a blood orange fan.  We placed our order of margaritas.The house sour has a unique taste to it. Didn't quite like it and I recommend asking to taste it before you place your order. The light margarita drink was clear and crisp and I don't typically drink light drinks but this was good and tasted way better then the one with the sour mix. Many of the drinks are made with the house sour mix. I got the tacos- chicken and shrimp which were tasty. The rice was stick, but I liked the refried beans I was nice to dip my chips in.

      "After hearing through the grapevine and keeping tabs on construction for this establishment, we were surprised and de****LIGHTED**** to hear that The Peculiar Rabbit was holding a soft open this past week. Had heard that it was going to be \"Jack's Across the Tracks\" and a few other rumors that made no sense. After seeing another gastro-pub open in town, the time was ripe to check it out! Here's my take:\n",
      "\n",
      "The exterior and general aesthetic doesn't exactly scream gastro-pub. It has taken an odd shape with some serious standout qualities. My favorite part is the giant logo literally stamped on the side of the building. Definitely makes a statement. \n",
      "\n",
      "The interior is very chic and a little more trendy than I anticipated. Wasn't expecting to see such a heavy bar scene. Long bar on the 1st and 2nd floors that I'm pretty sure mimic one another to a T. When it comes to a night out in Plaza, beer is always on the menu. I was pretty disappointed with the beer selection. The draught brews consisted of some NC beers, but only Copper from Olde Meck. Think it'd be nice to get some of the other local breweries on board as well. The bottle selection is decent. Had a chance to order a New Castle brew I had never had.\n",
      "\n",
      "The menu was a bit limited due to the soft open. We stared with the twice-baked potatoes and pretzels. First, the twice-baked were pretty bland. The creme fraiche was very well executed, but the rest of the dish was forgettable. With only three tiny potatoes, I wouldn't look to order this again. The pretzels....divine. The presentation was great and the portions, hefty two-bite sized pieces, were perfectly crunchy on the exterior and chewy on the inside. The beer cheese, which seems to be rather popular as of late, is splendid. Great texture and subtle flavor. Also came with spicy stone-ground mustard.\n",
      "\n",
      "We decided to split an entree. Went with Banh Mi. My goodness. Talk about divine. The pork was so flavorful and was reminiscent of some other great Banh Mi I've had. The veggies were fresh and complemented well. The bread, sourced local, was a nice touch. Very good stand up for that juicy which. \n",
      "\n",
      "The views are absolutely stunning. It was an absolutely gorgeous night and the skyline couldn't have been set more perfectly. The roof deck is by far one of the most impressive in town. I'm looking forward to dining there next time! \n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most admirable aspects is the farm-to-table practice. Great to see the menu littered with local sources and our server had a great knowledge of where specific items had come from. A rather important trait for a biz to have these days to stay on the radar of Charlotte's culinary-minded. \n",
      "\n",
      "One thing we couldn't really handle was the noise level. We were sitting across from one another and yelling to hear each others' words. Wonder if there would be an option for sound dampening on the 2nd floor? Also, the natural light that comes in with the sunset was blinding. Curtains will definitely be a must in the coming weeks. \n",
      "\n",
      "My biggest critique is the parking situation. Goodness gracious. Everywhere you can park around the building is permanently taken and other parking spaces around that part of plaza are marked with what seems like \"PARK HERE AND DIE\" types of signs. If they can work something out with local parking spaces after regular biz hours for surrounding businesses or look into comped valet perhaps, it would serve them well. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think TPR has some serious potential with that space. Their menu and beer list will definitely see some tweaking and I look forward to the result. Like many new places, there will be many changes made for flow, better service, and overall experience. I'm definitely a fan and the service and experience given to us will have us coming back in the near future. The views alone from the roof will keep us coming back on cool, clear nights!\n",

The yellowtail sashimi tasted offensively fishy, the pickled fennel was cut too thick and extremely hard to bite into, and the overall, combined flavors of the dish was unappetizing.

Staying at the Flamingo put us just a quick brisk walk to the Imperial Palace and up the escalator dedicated to Hash House.

      "BUT, the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles is note worthy. Perfectly Fried Chicken breast that were very moist with a crisp, not overly salty, crust hinted with sage was probably the best fried chicken I recall having (although I rarely eat fried chicken). The waffles were inventive with the strips of bacon entwined in the batter in stead of bacon bits mixed in the waffle. This was perfect as the bacon didn't overpower, but accented the waffle and still gave you the satiety of have two strips of bacon with your meal. The maple reduction tasted more like balsamic, but really high****LIGHTED**** the dish and I recommend using the sauce on your food and not avoiding it. \n",

The next visit we split the french toast which was just as huge with a griddle banana that was still in the skin split atop the super thick sliced bread.

For this Vegas trip, we stayed at Planet Hollywood, so it was very convenient for us to come here to order and bring it back to the hotel. That was exactly what we did, and it made our dinner plans quick and easy after a four hour drive from Los Angeles. The line moves quickly and you are given a buzzer after you pay for the order. \n",

It's around $7.49 for a sandwich, which is cheap for Vegas. The sandwiches are sliced into two and they're decently sized for a meal. The other items on the menu also sound good, especially the breakfast sandwiches, but I didn't get the chance to give them a try. Hopefully the next time i'm in Vegas, I can!\n",

      "I introduced my son, Ben, to Joe's while he was here for an adult-league soccer tournament, and we and Diane all came away from the 2-hour experience happy diners.  In the distant past, I found the Florida Stone Crab Claws to not be that tasty or worth the work of searching through torn shells to scoop out the meat.  But we were in a stone-crab place, so introducing my son to stone crab claws seemed appropriate.  To make sure that we would have a pleasing appetizer course, I hedged by also ordering a Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail, which I knew would be good.  This time the stone crab meat was an eye-opening experience.  I opted for the large claw variety, one for each of us, and wished I had ordered more as my son and I de****LIGHTED**** in the sweet, fresh taste of our crab meat, while Diane did not.  I sampled her claw meat, which was light brown in color and not very tasty, while mine was snow white and delicious.  So, I now know that Stone Crab claws can vary in taste.  And, one is not enough.  But at over $13 a large claw, this is not for those with a low dining out budget!  The Shrimp Cocktail was fine and meaty, as expected.\n",

      "A bowl of Crab Bisque was up next.  Very good with bits of crunchy garnish, but warm rather than hot.  I appreciated the pitted Black Olives in Joe's Chopped Salad, and liked the Feta Cheese-laced creation, but missed the prosciutto, pancetta, or ham commonly found in Chopped Salads served in Italian restaurants, which I realize Joe's is not.  So, next time I will revert to ordering a Caesar Salad here.  \n",

      "With all of the Surf & Turf combinations I had recently enjoyed on a cruise around South Africa and during the December holidays just past, I took an unusual detour, and swiveled instead to Chopped Steak for my entree, which is prime grade beef, ordered medium.  I should have ordered it medium-rare, because it arrived medium-well.  Yet showered with a carafe of brown au jus, the meaty dish was still quite tasty.  My son loved his Dover Sole, which was deboned tableside (but for 1 small bone), slathered with Buerre Blanc, and an absolutely huge double-sided fish fillet.  And Diane greatly enjoyed her medium-rare filet dipped in Bearnaise Sauce and 10 oz. Lobster Tail dunked in Drawn Butter.  Our server thought that we had ordered enough potato already before I added French Fries to orders of Crispy Hash Brown Potatoes and a Baked Sweet Potato adorned with of all things (Wait for this!) sweet and memorable Praline Pecan Butter.  But crispy Fries just go too well with Chopped Steak to forego.  And, after my son enjoyed a Caesar Salad, we rounded out these sides with tasty Roasted Cauliflower graced by Sage Brown Butter, and a dish of impeccably prepared Sauteed Spinach.  The huge order of slightly crunchy Hash Browns was superior in every sense, and the skin-on Fries fresh and a perfect mate to my Chopped Steak.  The delectable Baked Sweet Potato was just a delightful bonus!  \n",

      "Service by our head waiter and his assistant, formally clad in the customary Chi-Town black tux style, was impeccable, and our head waiter very patiently helped me add the Lettuce Entertain You app to my mobile phone, and noticed that my email address was not initially accepted because an undesired space lurked between letters.  Once the technical error was corrected, reward points were quickly awarded and a $20 future dining credit appeared.\n",

The mustard and pickles were uninspiring, so it wasn't the usual experimentation I enjoy with a good meat or cheese board. The roasted vegetables - carrots, celeriac, turnip, and others - delicious ingredients, but drowned in butter.\n",

The burger ground included shortribs and bacon, and it was blended just enough to stick together well, but coarse enough that you experienced different tastes with each bite.

The atmosphere was cozy and conducive to all occasions. \n",
      "\n",
      "During our initial visit, we tried the 8-inch Funghi pizza ($7) prepared with roasted mushrooms, goat cheese, truffle oil, and chive. The generous amount of mushrooms was impressively stacked with great textures. The minimal amount of goat cheese was perfect for this particular pizza, as the light truffle oil and chive provided depth of flavors to accompany the crispy crust that came with a consistent crunch on every bite. Terrific combination of earthy flavors, it was by far the best mushroom pizza I have tried so far. \n",
      "\n",
      "We also had the Puttanesca pizza ($7) that came with calamari, shrimp, capers, spicy tomato sauce, olives, fennel, and calabrian chile. Wow. The firey spicy flavors gave a great balance to the sweet cheeses, salty capers and olives. The fennel added texture, and the handful of calamari and shrimp were delicious. The crust again, was crispy with a light crunch, and flavorful. I wished there could be more seafood added to the pizza, but the combination of flavors were unsurpassed. \n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the Vine Ripe Margherita pizza ($7) made with fresh vine ripe tomato, house made mozzarella, basil, and olive oil. Unlike other pizzerias, the flavor of basil was persistent and well integrated into every bite. I absolutely loved the taste of the olive oil on this pizza, and the melted thick mozzarella cheese was another that high****LIGHTED**** our meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "On our second visit, we wanted the 8-inch Funghi pizza ($7.50) again, but this time the experience was not as outstanding as the previous. The toppings were excellent and full of flavor, but the crust was unexpectedly soft and rubbery. Since their crust was just a touch thicker when compared to Bianco, Cibo, Federal, and Pomo, it should have cooked with a little more time to bring out the char and crunch in the flavorful crust.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also tried the Pesto pizza ($7.50) accompanied by roasted tomato, house made mozzarella, basil pesto, and pine nuts. Like the Funghi, the crust was disappointing, but this turned out to be my favorite pizza. The roasted tomato was juicy, flavorful, and came with a nice char. The house made mozzarella was excellent, especially when combined with the basil, garlic, and olive oil infused pesto sauce, and a handful of pine nuts. In subtle ways, the use of the olive oil was a good unifier to bring together an array of ingredients and flavors. \n",
      "\n",
      "For dessert, the Tiramisu ($4 with Yelp check-in) was moist, airy, with crushed toffee added for texture in-between each bite. I wished the Tiramisu could come with a hint of liquor, but it was still a wonderful way to end a meal. Santi seemed to enjoy the White Sangria ($5) much more than the Red. \n",

      "Their happy hour goes from 3-6pm daily, and the restaurant recently raised their prices by about 50 cents. Despite some inconsistencies in our experiences, I still consider this a viable option for those looking for gourmet pizzas at happy hour prices.

      "This is the story of how we saved $12 with a Groupon. The story starts late one night online. Groupon had a $12 for $24 deal so the purchase was made with the idea that LA is only a few hours from Vegas and we'll be out there in the six-months before the Groupon expires. Well time did what time does and the expiration date was fast up on us so a trip to Vegas was planned. Another couple was found to join us on the adventure and we made our plans to stop by the outlets to shop and then go here for dinner. So pretty much we drove to Vegas for dinner just to save $12. Doesn't make a ton os sense but it turned out to be a really fun day that was high****LIGHTED**** by some tasty grub and chocolate.\n",

      "So we drove all the way from LA to Vegas for dinner, that's a lot of pressure but Max Brenner lived up to the hype we had built up for it. The Unforgettable Spicy Tuna Salad Sandwich is actually unforgettable mostly because they put crushed up bbq chip in the sandwich which is something I've done after a night of drinking but never thought I'd see it in a restaurant. The Waffle fries that come with it are dusted with cocoa but I just didn't get any of that flavor. Maybe my taste buds had been over worked by the jalapenos from the sandwich. Next time I want to try the turkey burger, i hear it's bugerlicious. \n",

She of course asked for this when she ordered and I was amazed that when it came out she didn't have to ask for another side of alfredo sauce. The friends that were with us also ordered a pasta dish so there was some making a comparison between extra sauce and normal person sauce was easy. They didn't drown the pasta in alfredo but there was a little extra. I think it's because they have good hearty sauces and you don't need to drown pasta in it to get the goodness.\n",

Our first bite was the optional bread service, served with a notably good olive oil. For starters we had the much acclaimed chopped salad. I typically don't address salads much in my reviews, but this salad was one of the highlights of the meal and our trip - it was awesome for a couple reasons. First, the flavors were great.  I didn't catch all the components, but the freeze-dried corn added crunch, and the protein came from smoked salmon. Second, the theater of the salad presentation and preparation was awesome. The server presented the salad with its ingredients nearly arranged in rows, and he added the awesome buttermilk dressing and tossed it at the table. The results were amazing. Our second starter was the Chia Seared Tuna, with purple sticky rice, asparagus purée, fried leaks and greens. The colors and presentation were great but the flavors were more muted.

My friends really liked the prime ribs which was nice, but I'm more of a seafood person. For me, I think the crab legs in heat had more meat so I suggest that.

Perhaps a good deal for some, but not us; there were few of these restaurants in our local area. Still, our server mentioned this twice, and the manager actually came to our table to give us a 5+ minute spiel himself.

The local and sustainable emphasis (much produce from the giant urban Ohio City Farm with whom they partner) is admirable, but several menu items lack imagination. Among recent orders, the white bean veggie burger was deliciously unusual and the pretzel-encrusted chicken fine in principle, but the meat was a touch dry for the latter and the smashed potatoes that accompanied the meal were rather dull.

      "This is a nice little intimate restaurant and I really enjoyed my visit here. My friends and I came here and we had way more to eat than we could handle! For appetizers we got the calamari, garlic bread dip, and caesar salad. The calamari was so yummy, ****LIGHTED**** battered and fried, not overly greasy and soggy. Both the garlic bread and calamari came with a marinara dipping sauce which was a nice compliment to the dish. Then we ordered the crusted baked salmon, thin crust pizza, chicken marsala, and zucchini strings. The crusted baked salmon and zucchini strings were probably my favorite dishes out of everything. The salmon had a nice crunchy baked crust on the outside and was tender and juicy on the inside. Not too bland either, salmon tends to be if you don't prepare it right. I tend to like fried stuff so maybe that's why I was drawn to the zucchini strings. Little bits of zucchini ****LIGHTED**** fried, I do wish they had a dipping sauce for it, but it was like eating little veggie fries. The chicken marsala was a bit heavier to eat. It had a lot of sauce and cheese, but the chicken wasn't too dry. The thin crust pizza was a nice addition to our meal. Just a simple cheese, marinara, and basil pizza on a nice warm crust, yum! This restaurant fits in with the Italian feel of the Palazzo. You wouldn't think it was an Italian restaurant when you first walk in with the ****LIGHTED**** candles and fancy modern décor, you'd probably expect the checked red and white table clothes instead. Our table was right by the window so we got a great view of fireworks from the TI show across the street.\n",

The first time we were there on a Saturday night it was way too packed so it was hard to move around and dance without being bumped into. The second time we came on a Sunday night it was a better crowd. They aren't as pushy and rude like they are at Tao, probably because Tao has a younger crowd. They play good music, all of the latest and greatest and more hip hop R&B kind of stuff, I hate it when they play too many techno or trance songs! How do you dance to those?

I also ordered the cono salmon and the aceitunas (both liquid and stuffed olives). If you haven't had a liquid olive before, it is quite the experience.

Delicious and a big enough portion to make into 2.5 or 3 meals if you get a side (I did - the house potatoes, which were well-seasoned and thinly sliced, but could have used a bit more crispiness for my liking). \n",

I was de****LIGHTED**** to discover that, in addition to corn or flour tortillas, you can order them in lettuce wraps!!  I'm not a huge fan of tortillas, and this means I can fit more guacamole in my tummy, plus the lettuce is fresh and delicious, giving the tacos a lovely summery lightness.

Also, the timing of when all the food came out was out of sorts. The fries came a while after we ordered, but then it took even longer to get the appetizers out. I understand steak restaurants take a long time to get it right, but it felt inordinately long for the entrees even when the server said it was coming anytime now.

The potatoes were shaped like small slices of bread and cooked perfectly. The asparagus was outstanding, cooked al dente and topped with melted Parmesan cheese. The two entrees of choice were a 4 oz. filet of beef tenderloin and a plate of veal piccata. The filet was cooked as ordered and served with a rich veal reduction on the side, juicy and tender. The veal consisted of 3 perfectly cooked pieces in a wonderful caper sauce. Brian suggested that we order 3 to 4 small plates and his recommendation was spot on, just the right amount of food. The finale was tiramisu. The Lago rendition is served with a side of ice cream that melds perfectly with the cake. The desert was exactly to our liking.\n",

In addition to the margaritas we also ordered the \"Trio de Ceviche\" which gives you a choice of either Camaron, Pulpo, Pescado or Ahi.. We selected everything but the Pulpo. Now ceviche is one of my favorite dishes and I have to be honest it was just okay.. I really didn't get that over the top taste and have had it at places a lot less fancier and it was better..

If you've never been to DD, their Happy hour is awesome and runs until 8PM.   The HH menu has a little bit of everything including starters, entrees, salads, drinks, and burgers.   I started off with the mushroom and brie fondue and a hibiscus margarita. Both were excellent; I just wish they served it with more dipping items. It came with a few small slices of pretzel and a couple veggies, so I ended up with a bunch of fondue and a spoon!  Other starters ordered included a shrimp \"cocktail\", pretzels and crab cakes.  Those who ate them seemed very pleased as they disappeared quickly.   For dinner I went with the Veggie burger.  It was homemade and very tasty.  Unfortunately I had gorged myself in fondue so was unable to eat hardly any of it.   A few other burgers were ordered at the table, some tacos, a huge salad (Which was on HH too) and a couple orders of sliders.

Our waiter introduced the specials including each dish's price, which our last server neglected to do. Our server also warned us that they tend to undercook their steaks and made recommendations how our steaks should be prepared. We took his advice and went with medium for their double eagle bone in steak and that did not disappoint! When our food came, they were all served on hot plates and since I was sharing my steak, they brought out an extra hot plate for me. I hadn't noticed the hot plate during my first visit so this may be new. I was very de****LIGHTED**** that this kept my food hot for a while, just the way I like it. We had also tried their lobster mac and cheese, which is mind blowingly good! Please get this as your side! You will be in heaven, I guarantee it! \n",

I can't take those that smell too strong but these were just perfect!  I had a nice strip view and at night, since the whole hotel is ****LIGHTED**** green, it gave my room a nice green shade.  I have to agree with other reviews that the photos of dead celebrities on the wall were kinda creepy.\n",

I had peeked at the menu ahead of time and was glad to see a number of vegan options in addition to gluten free and vegetarian.  The restaurant boasts an open kitchen where you see a dozen prep cooks working hard on a ton a fresh produce.  The brunch menu (wknds 10am - 4pm) has an awesome variety of breakfast, salads, sandwiches, entrees, pizzas, sides and starters.  They have fresh juice and lemonade concoctions in addition to a healthy cocktail and wine list. (I took a few pics of the menu for drink ideas at home!)  I ordered the Mediterranean chopped salad, sans cheese to make it vegan. My taste buds were de****LIGHTED**** with my selection!  I forgot to ask the server what the greens were in my salad... they were the tops/greens of something, but I couldn't figure it out by taste. Whatever it was, it perfectly complimented the almonds, quinoa, cucumbers, grape tomatoes, kalamata olives, green beans and tomato-herb vinaigrette.  I do lots of quinoa salads and this was a great one.  \n",

      "\n",
      "I went to Picasso a long time ago and enjoyed it. Picasso is a longstanding French restaurant in the Bellagio that is known for its million-dollar paintings on the wall, its view of the Bellagio Fountains and its exquisite cuisine from Julian Serrano. While I enjoyed Picasso, I haven't been back because their menu does not change much especially their signature tasting menu, which always features a lobster salad, roasted scallop with potato mousseline, seared foie gras and mains like lamb loin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Picasso offers a build-your-own 4-course menu, but that too is a mix of always there dishes with just a few seasonal touches. Still, I haven't been in a while so I decided to give them another shot and go the 4-course route this time. My dinner started with an amuse of delicious chilled potato and leek soup garnished with almond slices. The soup was accompanied by a crispy croquette filled with a creamy pheasant center and topped with Serrano ham. Okay bread and butter followed with choices like French baguette and olive bread.\n",
      "\n",
      "My first course was a warm quail salad, and I loved the quail. The quail breast was juicy and tender with a very appetizing crispy skin. There was also rich quail leg stuffed with foie gras. The garnishes were quite dainty but good and included bitter frisee, crunchy pine nuts, artichokes, and a truffle vinaigrette.\n",
      "\n",
      "My second course was a foie gras torchon. The foie gras was very creamy and buttery though lacked the strong meaty flavor of excellent foie gras. Luckily, the garnishes were top notch. The foie gras was high****LIGHTED**** with Harry's strawberries and jam--some of the best strawberries around with an unbelievable sweetness. There were also brioche croutons and almonds on the plate.\n",
      "\n",
      "My main course was a full roasted squab, and it was exceptional. Squab is my favorite protein, and this is one of the best preparations I've ever had. The squab breast was red, juicy, tender, and with a great bounciness to it. The skin was thick, flavorful and crispy. The squab leg was also good and provided a duck confit-like flavor and texture. I really enjoyed the side of blanched asparagus and carrots--simply prepared but memorable. There was also a side of wild rice risotto, which was just okay. I liked how they used a light side given the other heavy items throughout their menu, but this wild rice preparation wasn't really elevated over other wild rice dishes I've had.\n",
      "\n",
      "My dessert was a warm chocolate fondant, which was satisfying though not remarkable. The cake had a nice contrast between the cake-like exterior and the warm, liquid (but still thick) chocolate center. They used a really dark chocolate (strong bitter notes though some sweet notes too), and this resulted in a kind of dry-like experience (the dry chocolate sable base only added to the dry texture I felt on my palate). It was the kind of rich chocolate experience that would work better as a dessert accompaniment (like a sauce over profiteroles and vanilla ice cream) than the centerpiece of a dessert. This dessert was accompanied by creamy Bailey's and butterscotch ice cream with a noticeable Bailey's flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dinner ended with decent mignardises and banana chocolate chip muffins to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service was excellent--polished, professional, polite, and friendly. Picasso is the type of restaurant where they know guests are spending a lot to dine there, and the whole staff goes out of their way to make the dining experience as special as possible. Prices are surprisingly reasonable given the exceptional quality Picasso achieves. Picasso is significantly less expensive than Joel Robuchon, Guy Savoy and even other less notable fine dining and steak-driven restaurants on The Strip.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've enjoyed both of my dining experiences at Picasso, and it is a perfect fit for Vegas. Vegas is filled with establishments that do not change. Picasso somehow excels at continuing to produce the same dishes year after year without diminishing returns. If you are looking for consistency as well as the type of premium experience you expect to find in Vegas, Picasso is one of your best options.\n",

      "D'Liteful (*ducks tomato*)!  The small but mighty breakfast and lunch drive thru (formally known as D'Lish) has been a faint curiosity for me since I first drove past what looked like a line of about 10 cars eager to get their fix at this place.  I can't say with any credibility whether that is a normal crowd.  But having seen similar lines for drive thru's like In & Out Burger and Dutch Bros Coffee, I figured there'd had to be something behind the long lines.  So around 7:30am on a Sunday it was off to D'Lite's flagship location in South Scottsdale for breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Surprisingly upon my arrival there were only a pair of cars in front of me.  Additionally I saw that there was the option to park and dine in rather than go the drive thru route.  So dine in I did.  The space is fairly small with seating for maybe 20 inside and another 10 outside.  Parking is also limited with space for maybe 6-8 cars so depending on your arrival time dining in may simply not be practical, but the drive thru line was moving at a pretty decent clip regardless.  For dining in just order at the register, pick a seat inside or out and the good stuff is brought right out to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "As this was my first go around here, I had done a little bit of research in advance and saw two particular items that were helpfully high****LIGHTED**** as \"signature\" items on the menu.  Seems like a good place to start.  So for my drink, I went with their Breakfast Buzz shake.  A 24 oz mix of nonfat milk, peanut butter, banana, chocolate syrup, espresso, whey protein, and other vitamins all blended together with ice.  To be clear, I'm not a coffee drinker so the espresso aspect gave me a little trepidation, but honestly I didn't pick up any real coffee texture with this drink.  The two most dominant flavors were the chocolate and peanut butter.  The shake basically tasted like a Reese's Peanut Butter cup in liquid form (which is just fine by me).  For my breakfast dish, I also went \"signature\" and chose their California Club sandwich.  Egg, bacon, turkey, tomato, avocado, pepper jack cheese, cream cheese & pesto on toasted artisan bread.  Pretty decent sandwich and a just right portion, though I'll admit the tomato flavor might've been a little too dominant here.  Would've preferred a little more emphasis on the turkey and bacon and I didn't pick up hardly any of the pesto or cream cheese flavoring.  That said I liked the portion of avocado and the egg was also emphasized just the right amount.\n",
      "\n",
      "Total cost for the shake and the sandwich including tax came to $15.  Both items came out within 2 minutes and it seemed like the D'Lite staff paid just as much attention to their dine in customers as their drive thru ones so both dining options are equally viable.  In addition to their flagship spot in South Scottsdale, they also have a location in North Scottsdale and in Tempe.  Overall I was pretty satisfied with my first breakfast outing here.  It wasn't perfect, but it was enjoyable, affordable, and efficient.  I would certainly come back for breakfast and will likely try their lunch menu at some point (rumor has it their house style protein burgers are popular).  D'Lite yourself in d'licious d'lectable goodness.  Sorry, I'll see myself out now.\n",

That's the main reason I'm not giving a 5-star rating. Especially considering the large plating options they use here I just wonder who thought such a small table was appropriate for dining? Drinking lattes, sure, but for full-blown meals? No way!\n",

      "Our server seemed de****LIGHTED**** that we would be taking part in their RW menu, she asked if we wanted wine, but my mother and I both declined and got Ice Teas instead. Once we took a look at the menu, it was obvious we would each order something different and share. So, with that being said, the following is what my mother and I ate:\n",

      "/Banana Tempura Fondue: warm & crispy banana bites, pure milk chocolate dip, toffee sauce \n",
      "\n",
      "The hummus and roasted peppers that came with the pita chips were very good and the peppers were an excellent addition. The burger was delicious. I can't compliment the chefs here enough on how well they cooked the burger to my mother's specifications, medium well. The spicy tuna salad sandwich I think I could eat everyday and it has practically changed my mind about tuna sandwiches all together. If every restaurant could make tuna like that, I would eat it every time I go out.\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt as though the pizza was not as good as it is hyped up to be. The dough/bread was the downfall for me. Yes, it is clever and cute, but when it comes to taste - meh. I personally think everyone should go with the fondue! Because the banana tempura was out of this world! \n",

      "I really love how they went all out with the \"village\" theme. When you walk in, it really feels like you're strolling through a little village. There are signs, street lamps, little rooms, and buffet stations that look like little cottages. I'm always a sucker for any kind of themed restaurant, so I loved this.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were quickly seated in one of the rooms and had our drink orders taken. Then we went out to explore the buffet. It looked like they just restocked everything, so I was pretty de****LIGHTED****. There was also a very large selection that seems to continue all throughout the room with separate stations for dessert and soup/salad. I got some broccoli, mushrooms, 3 different pastas, mussels, potatoes, fish, strips of steak, sushi, green beans, roast beef, sausage, cold crab legs, and cam chowder. To be honest, I didn't expect that to fill be up, but it did, so i went on to dessert and got two crème brûlées, a couple cookies, and flan (I'm a slave to dessert). \n",

      "\n",
      "Featuring a collection of Comfort Foods concocted by Hard Rock Executive Chef Marcus O'Brien, and manned by a dedicated team from front of house to the kitchen crew, Mr. Lucky's 24/7 sits Casino-center in a sprawling space that features punk-rockers like The Ramones and Circle Jerks set beneath a soundtrack ranging from Funk to Classic Rock, the menu taking a similarly aggressive yet all-encompassing approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Focused largely on the All-Day Breakfast section, a few half-portions requested in order to sample widely without wasting food, the meal got started with a glass of ice water alongside two items certainly not undersized in their proper format, the daily \"Pie Shake\" seeing a fresh slice of Peanut Butter and Chocolate pureed into a Vanilla Ice Cream base with crust as the garnish - an even more eye-popping embellishment offered by way of The Hard Rock Bloody Mary with a hefty bit of spice tucked beneath a top-heavy skewer complete with Shrimp, Deviled Eggs and a Waffle Slider plus several types of Meat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Told that the recently reformulated Sweet Cream Pancakes would now be featured with traditional toppings as well as a \"Pancake of the Week,\" suffice it to say that at $11.99 for a Full-stack the fluffy Flapjacks offer a significant deal for those looking to share, even the two-cake Shortstack large enough that most will not put a dent in it despite the current offering of Butterscotch Chips and toasted Pecans being especially delicious even without butter or additional accoutrements.\n",
      "\n",
      " Continuing the sweet theme with a fryer-basket of airy Cinnamon-Sugar Donut Holes and a sidecar of Nutella, savories from Mr. Lucky's Breakfast are high****LIGHTED**** by the kitchen sink-style Home Skillet with an assortment of Meats and Vegetables layered amidst skillet Potatoes beneath two Eggs and Melted Cheddar, the Breakfast Quesadilla offering a similar concept well-suited for those wishing to eat something lighter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still offering the same delicious French Toast as 32 months prior, a true case of \"if it ain't broke, why fix it?\" with Mascarpone and Strawberries atop Brioche made crunchy by way of Cornflakes, a taste of one of Mr. Lucky's Specialty Burgers showed a good sear on both Beef and Turkey Patties beneath Bacon, Cheese and Hollandaise, the Pretzel bun standing up admirably to the heft of ingredients, though those looking to not make a mess may still wish to indulge with a fork and knife anyways.\n",
      "\n",
      "Extending the comfort food concept to desserts, American favorites like Cheesecake and Banana Splits joined by several more plus the aforementioned Shakes and Pies, suffice it to say that Mr. Lucky's does not scale back when it comes to the sweeter part of the morning, afternoon or evening - the wedge of Red Velvet separating dense layers by ribbons of Cream Cheese Frosting while both the steamy Sticky Toffee Pudding and reference standard Cobbler are even stronger offerings with the former not dissimilar to a Bacon-spiked version at 35 Steaks + Martinis and the later perhaps trumping Yardbird for tops in Sin City.\n",

      "FOUR STARS:  Not fine dining by any stretch, but going the extra mile to be better than it has to be, Mr. Lucky's 24/7 again proves the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino to be an underappreciated property in terms of its dining options, and almost universally a bargain compared to similar Strip-based entities.\n",

      "Duck recently removed from the menu, but still with numerous entrees, steaks and sides made to share, it was on the server's recommendation that the tender Bone-In Filet was ordered and cooked just past medium-rare the flavor was plentiful, though not as robust as that at Jean Georges, Delmonico or Carnevino, while the Dover Sole spoke to Hopcraft's skills sharpened while working with Michael Mina, a simple roast rendering the white flesh flaky yet moist with brown butter and capers plus crisp fingerlings that might be even better than STK's addictive Parmesan Truffle Fries.\n",

I can say that this appears to be one of the greatest values for a room in the city! Only paying $45 a night or so for several nights was a steal! The room was very clean, had a great view, and was stocked with many great amenities. \n",

      "The great thing about the Orleans is that you could do so many things and not have to leave the property! In addition to gambling, eating, and drinking, you are also able to go bowling, see a movie, check out a concert or sporting event. All of this at a very affordable price!\n",

You have the statue of Big Al the Alligator and his jazz band at the entry, just for starters! I love the large, ****LIGHTED**** masked heads over the pit, as well. When you check in or go sign up at the players club, you get those  little beaded necklaces! lol It's just cheesy and fun!\n",

      "TOSTADA: Happily served as a duo despite the singular name! The tortilla itself lacked the crisp I had expected, but was generously topped with shredded pork and slaw, as well as a fried quail egg. This needed a touch of something else, maybe the salsa from the previous dish?\n",
      "CRISPY FRENCH TOAST: I'm not a French Toast fan, but our server recommended it. The toast itself was crusted with granola, but wasn't particularly crispy. The creme anglaise and coffee flavors made this only lightly sweet, but it went unfinished at our table.\n",
      "CROQUE MADAME: I haven't met a Croque Madame I've liked until now. Usually the layers of ham and cheese and bechamel are just too rich and salty, but this version on challah high****LIGHTED**** the salty gruyere and showed restraint with the sauce. The egg was perfectly poached and the side salad lightened things up. \n",
      "SHORTY BENEDICT: Worth the hype. Generous amounts of tender short rib (roasted on site!) and more perfectly poached eggs top the grilled bread with a bernaise-red wine reduction. This could have used just a hint of salt but it was pretty great as-is too. The side of house potatoes were nicely crunchy.\n",

      "It should be said that not all vegetarian and vegan food is necessarily healthy.  Sure, a lot of folks adopt veganism or vegetarianism for the health benefits.  But even meatless foods can have junk food appeal.  Perhaps you're scared of going vegetarian and want to try something that tastes just like your favorite chicken wings.  Or perhaps you're already vegetarian, but you're craving a great All-American burger but without the burger patty guilt.  For those of you who've never been to Green, take it from this carnivore.  This is the place to get your junk food fix (and a few healthy fixes as well).\n",
      "\n",
      "Truth be told I've been to Green a number of times.  The menu has changed a little here and there, but the core of Green's appeal remains the same.  A place where vegan and vegetarian foods can be creatively woven to mimic the foods we all know and love, pushing the boundaries of what vegetables can do.  At first glance it would seem hilariously out of place to see items like a burger, or a cheesesteak or buffalo wings while perusing the menu of a vegetarian restaurant.  But for owner and head chef Damon Brasch, that's the whole point.  Opening the public's eyes to whats possible to construct with creativity and an almost religious devotion to avoiding meat and meat byproducts.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've had a number of items on the menu in the past including the Buffalo Wings, the Chili Cheese Fries, and even the Crab Puffs.  All vegan, all surprising, all quite tasty.  For tonight's visit with the Yelp Veg Curious UYE crew, I decided to attack an item I had yet to tackle.  You've all heard of the Big Mac (two all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun).  Wait till you get a load of the Big Wac.  Same basic recipe, but the patties?  Yup, vegan.  To make it an All-American meal I went with their Thyme Fries on the side and one of their house made lemonades.  Total cost including tax came to about $15.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would invite any longtime McDonald's Big Mac fan to try the Big Wac and point out any truly noticeable differences in the texture of Green's version of this American food icon.  As with the rest of Green's menu, you find yourself perplexed at how they can make a vegan version of these dishes taste like the genuine article.  To this day I don't know how they make the Buffalo Wings taste like legit chicken, or how they mimic the crab so accurately.  All I can say is Chef Brasch has incredible imagination.  Some dishes I've had here are better than others of course, but even those that fall short are not for lack of creativity.\n",

      "So if you're among the flocks of those steering clear of meat but want the closest approximation to a meat menu you can find, you'd be hard pressed to find many places in the valley of sun that can accomplish that fete the way Green has.  The prices for the food are also quite reasonable, and the restaurant itself is a pretty cool spot on 7th Street (just be aware parking can be a bit of pain as many Yelpers have noted).  When you do come here, be sure to save room for dessert next door at Green's sister restaurant Nami.  And if you're a suspicious carnivore coming here for the first time as I once was, prepare to be confused, surprised, and de****LIGHTED****.  And most importantly, full.\n",

They have old school video games like Donkey Kong, Centipede, Tron, Tetris, Dig Dug and more. They have claw machines as well. They have air hockey too. Overall not a bad place to check out.

I've been craving chicken and waffles, so obviously I went with the Mornin' Style - and was not disappointed by the sweet and savory Rosemary waffles. It was a little much after the biscuits though, and I would have enjoyed a side salad to balance out the carbs + protein. All the fried chicken is lightly crisped and tender, as well as BONELESS, so you can actually attempt to use a fork and knife! The fried coating is less greasy than at Hot Sauce Williams and not as hard as KFC, which was much preferred for me. \n",

Let's just say after the first sip yogurt soda is an acquired taste. While I liked the yogurt sourness the saltiness of the soda was way too much. Fortunately the waiter was observant and brought over a glass of iced water by his own accord. I have to tell you that the service here is attentive and friendly. \n",

Joking aside, this was a beautiful puree of chickpeas, tahini or sesame seed paste, lemon juice and garlic. Usually this is served super garlicky elsewhere I was de****LIGHTED**** to find this version to be well balanced and flavorful. Getting the same treatment as the homos, the Babaghanooj ($2.99) contains roasted eggplant instead of chickpeas.

      "Kabob Koubideh ($7.49) sounds like quite a mouthful and let me tell you this, it was. Pounded ground meat marinated in onion juice, and then grilled to a juicy smoky excellence. The meat reminded me of a Middle Eastern take on chopped steak, sublimely tender. Along side was a huge pile of super light basmati rice, fresh hot pita and creamy yogurt salad. A sprinkling of sumac over the entire plate adds a slight sourness, which melds incredibly well with this type of food. \n",

There is live music here from Thursday thru Saturday in the evenings and adds to the ambience. A very nice touch to this quaint place with amazing food. It's definitely tight in here. It reminds me of cafes in Europe. You may or may not get to know your eating neighbors. So since we are conserving aqua.. I started with the Paloma. It came delivered by our friendly waiter with a salted rim and consisted of Patron Reposado Tequila, Mexican grapefruit soda and fresh lime juice. My husbands house margarita was legitimately worthy. We started with the table side guacamole. Our waiter rolls up and makes this with whatever you like. Pomegranates? We will pass. But everything else and it was perfect with awesome chips. The bread and an olive spread paste that was complimentary for the table was very good too. The menu is so diverse and some of the best native Mexican dishes from Chef Silvana Salcido Esparza that I have seen outside of Mexico. It's truly hard to decide on one thing! I ended up ordering the Enchiladas del Mar. These enchiladas are blue corn tortillas  filled with quesos of Oaxaca and de cabra, topped with lots of shrimp, lump crab and scallops in a tomatillo cream. I had the scallops held and that wasn't a problem. One small issue after they were delivered, is that I wanted a salsa type sauce. My waiter seemed either confused or taken aback. I even pointed out the sauce/salsa on other plates on the table and he pretty much just didn't bring it! Cmon now! The enchiladas were amazing! I just wanted to 'salsa' them up a little.. okay. So, one of the other people got an extra salsa and simply passed it to me. As, he simply never brought it. While dining the Filet de mi Tita arrived at the table next to us. I have never been one to go to a Mexican cafe and order steaks.. THIS time.. its on my 'to go back and order list'.. THIS steak was HUGE! It was on the menu for $26 and was piled with crab. I have had lesser filets in steak restaurants for way , WAY more than that price! Following dinner I ordered the cafe. I had no idea this was going to arrive in a larger than normal french press! $3.95 and you get a HUGE french press full of amazing Mexican cafe and pure cream..if you choose. Enough to share, trust me. We also just HAD to share the Churros Rellenos de Cajeta de Cabra. They are also pretty big! Shareable and filled with creamy, rich goat's milk and caramel; then served warm with vanilla ice cream , MORE warm caramel and candied pecans. The Flan de mi Miami. I mean, we had to order and share this too! Also topped with candied pecans and a little Kahlua and a generous portion, as well. Melt in your mouth amazing. \n",

My mind flashed back to my college trip to the Kiwi Isle.  Back then I was determined to eat something New Zealand other than the fruit.  Everytime I asked where a good \"New Zealand style\" restaurant would be I ended up directed to a mediocre Chinese buffet.  Sorry, New Zealanders that is from China; the Maoris did not invent General Tso's chicken.  Perhaps my culinary quest was at an end.  I pulled in to the boring suburban strip mall and 'Sushi bar' was stenciled on the windows underneath.  Slightly disappointed I decided to give it a whirl anyway, though a bit skeptical that sushi in a southern suburb might resemble that in a King of the Hill episode that was derived from canned tuna.  Opening the door however I de****LIGHTED**** to see a very tastefully decorated and quaint interior with what looked to be actual Asians and not disguised Mexicans.  I, of course, tried the local Charlotte roll which was an Avocado on top style, my favorite.  It was delicious.  I'm quite pleased with my strip mall gem.\n",

What a bum!  Surprisingly, business was bustling this morning-- I've never seen PC full of people, and get this, there was a LINE waiting to order!  Because most of the tables were taken indoors, it was very noisy, so I took this chance to hide my I'm-sick-as-a-dog bum from the beautiful people and eat OUTDOORS.  But first, I had to place my order.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since I'd already perused the menu online, I knew I was going to have the French toast, no powdered sugar, please, like I usually do, but I wanted to try something new.  The basic breakfast (egg, toast, jam, and fruit) enticed, but I quickly drew towards Kamut toast, almond butter, jam, and fruit.  I also thought I'd either try a smoothie or an elixir ($8 each), but the menu online stated to ask for an elixir menu for options.  There was only one, and it was a \"female hormonal concoction\" with something, I lost track, since I didn't need help with my hormones, thank you very much.  (\"Not that there's anything wrong with that.\")  $8 saved.  The smoothie I wanted to try contained pomegranate juice, which I correctly suspected had one or more unwanted ingredients, and for me, that was \"grape seed oil extract.\"  (So glad I spotted those juice bottles in front of the cash register.)  Good- I was able to hang onto $8 of my money.  Last, but not least, I ordered a cappucino (Cartel Coffee) and a glass of water without cucumber.  I again reiterated that I did not want powdered sugar on the French toast, which I was told would take twenty or twenty-five minutes to be ready, since they'd run out of the bread and the next batch was in the oven.  I said it was worth waiting for, so I don't mind, and besides, I'll have the kamut toast and almond butter.  As I paid for my three items, I was told that my food will be out in about 30 minutes, which took me by surprise, but I was in no mood to make a fuss, especially when I needed to secure an empty table before someone else snatched it!\n",

One thing I really like about frequenting vegan/vegetarian/gluten-free venues, is how most, if not all, of the staff members are so humble, and are good-natured.  Another thing is that these venues tend to look so hippy-chic, colorful, eclectic, and FUN!  I loved the different swaths of colorful curtains, brightly-painted tables and chairs, whimsical dinnerware, and that was indoors!  Outside, I found a mosaic two-top with mismatched chairs- I sat on the one without the morsel of food on its seat.\n",

(There's a reason cucumber slices are used to \"flavor\" the water, folks!)  It was about ten minutes after I started sipping my coffee that the Banana bread French toast arrived http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QsJ6orXv_VB7xz-MpqHzSQ?select=ZPZ8wSo4IPOrtAmFWejCcw#ZPZ8wSo4IPOrtAmFWejCcw, but it was sprinkled with powdered sugar!  However, Russell did not hesitate in taking it back and bringing another.  What terrific service!  The Kamut toast, almond butter, jam, and fruit plate stayed, however, so I was happy. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QsJ6orXv_VB7xz-MpqHzSQ?select=s3KbSXITa6YEFvYgGYv91g#s3KbSXITa6YEFvYgGYv91g  Still happy, even when I found out that the almond butter was the raw variety-- I don't particularly like its flavor, or lack thereof, and I only buy and enjoy the roasted kind.  It's a good thing I am not allergic to chia (still experimenting), sesame, and sunflower seeds, for while the menu did not mention these were included, one certainly could not avoid their presence on this dish!  It's also a good thing they were, since they gave the bland-tasting almond butter much-needed flavor.  The fun textures on this dish also gave my mouth something to be happy about!  The Banana bread French toast arrived about 5 minutes later, and what a marvel that was! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QsJ6orXv_VB7xz-MpqHzSQ?select=vfafsHCzso2InWi-kcDWBg#vfafsHCzso2InWi-kcDWBg  The French toast had the PERFECT crunch on the outside, a gorgeous pound-cake-meets-angel-cake consistency on the inside, and a wonderful roasted-banana scent filled the air around my face that soon de****LIGHTED**** my taste buds!

The kids in our group really wanted pasta though so I thought I'd call to see if perhaps the information on Yelp was incorrect. They do in fact accept take out orders.

All of our orders were delicious and definitely comprised of quality ingredients. It took about a 10 minute wait to make our order.\n",

Only caveat is that the serving sizes are on the smaller side - arguably not really a surprise for fine dining.

The Shrimp and Grits ($11.99) was delicious. It is creamy with a mild spiciness to it. I had a piece of shrimp in almost every bite, which is something I always hope for.

Then toss it with veggies into a taco shell and coat it with a house made sauce like the pink gold - yogurt based sweet & spicey - or the blueberry chutney, which pretty much speaks for itself in excellence.

      "Still one of my favorite resorts on the LV Strip, it strikes that near perfect balance of location, luxury, floor layout, price, nightlife and restaurants.  While still not topping my #1 ranked place (The Wynn) the Palazzo still ranks high for being a bit more accessible pricewise, and the fact they sent me multiple comps in the past, always enough to make me a fan.\n",

      "As part of the Venezia group, the Palazzo is neighbors and connected to the famous Venetian hotel and while the main structure of the resort is a near clone of the Venetian's main tower, it just makes a lot more sense to me.  While the Venetian is an enormous sprawling mess created out of a hodgepodge of mismatching buildings, making it a near Indiana Jones-like adventure to locate anything, the Palazzo sticks with a clean, orderly, symmetric floor layout that's consistent from the Lobby, upwards.  This means I don't get hopeless lost when finding a place or my room for that matter, compared to its sister resort.\n",

      "The pool area is also great, affording a view out on the strip as well as being dominated by the beautiful elegant structure of the hotel itself.

      "\n",
      "* Crispy Brussel Sprouts \"brussel sprouts, lemon chili, mint, puffed rice\" ($6) - This came out rather immediately and set the tone for the rest of the meal.  (The Husband had high hopes for this dish and the result would probably reflect how much we would enjoy the rest of our dinner.)  It was good...really good.  Yes, damn good.  It was a generous amount and we were loving it.  We were de****LIGHTED****.  \n",
      "\n",
      "* Crudo \"sea bass, heirloom tomato, ikura, candied quinoa, lemon herb oil\" ($12) - This next course took quite awhile to come out.  It wasn't as if they were cooking anything for it, but we were twiddling our thumbs waiting.  The presentation of this dish could be as to why the wait.  The candied quinoa is definitely different as its uncooked quinoa.  The Husband only wished he had more.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Takorizo \"grilled japanese octopus, chorizo, melon, almonds, salsa verde, black olive oil\" ($16) - Again, quite a wait for this dish too.  The octopus was warm, the melon was cool.  You need to take a bite of the chorizo, melon and octopus altogether to really appreciate the sweet and salty factor.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Hotateyaki \"sea scallops, tomatillo, cauliflower, grapefruit-ginger-miso vinaigrette\" ($13) - At this point, we realized we needed a fork and knife to cut down the food as chopsticks weren't cutting it.  (Plus, most items were served in quantities of five and we are all about sharing equally here!)  Another dish that requires you to get a piece of the scallop, tomatillo, and grapefruit segment all at once.\n",

      "\n",
      "* Sake Orenji \"atlantic salmon, orange supreme, yuzu tobiko, lemon oil, maldon\" ($10) - It was among one of our favorites.  The salmon and orange segments were a bit large and needed to be cut down, but the sauce that it lay in along with the yuzu tobiko were delicious.  My only problem was that the tobiko would fall off the fish and into the sauce and I had to dig around to get every little morsel out.  The busboy wanted to clear my plate and I was definitely not done digging around!\n",
      "\n",
      "* Sakana Dore \"fish of the day, bell pepper, zucchini chips, apple, micro greens, yuzu honey, tosaka seaweed\" ($15) - We were told the fish of the day was albacore and Yonaka was the only place in the Valley that had fresh albacore versus frozen albacore.  The waitress said it came from Hawai'i, so we decided to order it.  However, it came out with salmon instead of albacore.  They ended up comping this dish for us while they made a new order with albacore.  You really need to get every component of the dish into your mouth to enjoy the food.  The yuzu honey was superb!\n",
      "\n",
      "* Sakana Dore \"fish of the day, bell pepper, zucchini chips, apple, micro greens, yuzu honey, tosaka seaweed\" ($15) - This time it came with albacore, but the Husband actually preferred the salmon version.  This version was a bit fishier, but still good nonetheless.  And we were happy to get more yuzu honey!\n",
      "\n",
      "* Shioyaki Saba \"grilled norwegian mackerel, cucumber, lemon, parsley\" ($5) - Considering they said the dishes were meant to be shared, the saba was one large piece of fish sitting on a bed of English cucumbers.  Thank goodness for our knife and fork because we needed to cut down the cucumbers to enjoy a piece with every bite of fish, which was just cooked perfectly.  We made a point of pulling the fish to the side so it didn't soak up the sauce too quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Machitaki \"yellowtail tataki, asparagus, yuca chips, tomato ginger puree, soy pudding\" ($13) - This dish came highly recommended by our waitress and for good reason.  It was among one of my favorites.  The soy pudding wasn't exactly what I was expecting as its rather concentrated soy sauce and not soy like tofu.  Instead of asparagus, we got avocado, which tasted great anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Chokoreto \"lime, chocolate, mint, avocado\" ($7) - A generous chocolate heavy dessert with chocolate cookie, chocolate cookie crumbles, chocolate torte/pudding, lime sorbet, and dots of mint and avocado sauce.  I think I could have used a bit more mint and avocado though.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service - Ashlee, our waitress, was great - attentive and relatively knowledgeable.

      "It's a good thing I marveled at the decor for a bit; no one came to the table for a while which I thought was odd for this type of dinner. Finally, we requested to speak to the sommelier to get suggestions on French wine for our budget. When the somm came by, he replied that he had \"just the right one and would bring it over.\" I found it odd he didn't offer various options, but decided to trust him and let it go. After a good ten minutes or so passed, we inquired as to his whereabouts with a gentleman who stood nearby. Sure enough, the somm finally reappeared carrying a bottle of wine which we tasted and approved. Minutes later, the gentleman that helped us with the somm came by to icily take our order. By now, I must admit I felt annoyed. High-end restaurants with dismissive attitudes are not OK in my book. Proper? Yes. Pompous. No! I don't care how highly awarded you are. It's not OK. \n",

Naturally, before the Michelin Guide left Las Vegas, it had the very coveted three stars. As per my experience, it falls somewhere pricier than Eleven Madison (with a corkage fee) but less than Alinea/French Laundry (with wine pairings). The menu offers four options base priced at $127, $169, $198, or $250 pp. Basically, you combine a different number of appetizers, main courses, dessert, and mignardises. There are some supplementary charges as well. TIP: The $169 menu seemed to be the best option. No dessert needed. I thought it was odd they added the (usually complimentary) mignardises as an option, until I realized why. More on that in a bit. While the menu offered the expected classic French fare, the picturesque and tweezer-happy plating steered closer to French techniques of today. \n",

A cart with at least a dozen in-house freshly baked bread of all types rolled up. TIP: While it's easy to over-order (is there such thing as too much bread?) start slowly, the bread comes around often throughout the night. Once you choose, the butter cart appears. Of course, it does. French butter sliced individually and olive oil poured tableside, such a treat.  \n",

A stunning Wonka-esque display of sweets sat tableside, begging to be explored. I can't believe I'm admitting this, but I barely tried any. Darn souffle! It's probably my biggest regret of the night. Sigh. Because I happened to be celebrating my birthday, they also brought out a lovely and delicate complimentary meringue cake: adorned in spectacular pastel-colored rosettes and bearing a single candle.

His attention to detail was superb including having a chilled Voss water ready for us the second night, remembering my wife's drink, answering a question about the vanilla ice cream from the night before (yes they do scrap the vanilla bean seeds into the ice cream), bringing us the basil sorbet as a palette cleanser as we had suggested before, surprising us with a dish not on the menu, etc. Charles \"I am a young Wayne Newton\" Tansey III even stopped by to let us know that our disappointment with the chocolate cake (a bit dry and lacking flavor) had been addressed with the chefs especially after having tried it himself.

      "The owner was kind enough to participate in a great charity event on September 29, Alex Loves Lemonade Stand, in which all proceeds go to fight pediatric cancer. I have heard about Pizzeria Bianco for a few years and was de****LIGHTED**** when I found out that they were participating in this event. Please note that many legendary great chefs throughout the U.S were featured. The longest line was for Pizzeria Bianco. O.K., now I get it! That pizza was beyond delicious. I love that the chef was making that pizza dough on-site and brought along a portable wood-burning oven. OMG, I was thrilled to donate money to facilitate pediatric cancer research. However, when Pizzeria Blanco shows up with his great tasting samples and Suzanne Goin gives away her famous short ribs as sliders and Jonathan Waxman flies in from NYC to serve up a great skirt steak, you know you are in a for a good day. Consensus: Pizzeria Bianco \"stuck the landing.\" Thanks for mentoring Mario Batali and Nancy Silverton.  Fortunately, I have friends in Phoenix. Look forward to more than one great sample, and great it was.\n",

      "The original New Orleans Delmonicos gave me some of earliest foodie education.  WAY back before it was bought by Emeril, it was a Garden District favorite.  Many of the old, wealthy families of New Orleans dined there.  It was not on the tourist trail.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was distraught when Emeril bought Delmonicos.  I thought he was cheesy and obnoxious, and I just knew he was going to ruin this Southern matriarch.  I could not bring myself to go there and view the damage.\n",

      "The salt-foam margarita was incredible and well worth the price. The house red was underwhelming and I would opt for something else. The chicharones were fine, as were the sliders.

      "\n",
      "I love the old-school casinos with all of their pretty lights that remind you of all those old Vegas movie montages where they would show all of those ****LIGHTED**** signs one after another.  What's left of the Strip is on the endangered species list, but what they have here flourish from both still open casinos, and contributions from the Neon Museum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fremont Street East (in my opinion) is one of the best quality drinking areas in the city.  The majority of places don't gut you on prices, or you get what you paid for.  There are really good lounges (including Insert Coins, where you can play classic arcade games while you drink - though I more game there), and if you get there before the hipster crowd, you won't feel overwhelmed by the mobs of people.\n",
      "\n",
      "The area still retains a vibe of fun.  Ziplining is still going strong, semi-janky costumed mascots still pose for photo ops (my current amazing find is a guy dressed up as Minnie Mouse - perception all changes when that head comes off), this Summer is all about '80's music, so the atmosphere is lively and fun, and surprising but true, the Neonopolis is slowly returning.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I mean SLOWLY.  Don't expect to see the place thriving, but there is an awesome vintage toy store there, and hints that some mega Denny's is coming.  Ah, the ultimate \"work off that drunk\" bastion of eateries.  I REALLY hope they bring back a movie theater.  They really need to bring back a movie theater.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's weird to me how the Strip is so \"meh\" and eager to let old places rot until they can be torn down, yet a number of Fremont's old places get a beautiful full renovation, while keeping all the old-style charm.  Golden Nugget is a classy joint, and the Plaza is set to reopen with an all-new upgrade (going inside the Plaza now looks like the zombie apocalypse).  I'm impressed that they actually try to SAVE places down here.\n",
      "\n",
      "The area does need to expand its good-time feel farther, however, there gets a point where the lights, music and vibe die down, and it gets a little sketchy.  But people should recognize those areas long before you walk into them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Strip needs to take a long, hard look at what Fremont is doing to itself.  It's no longer the \"second grade\" section that people once considered it.  Sure, it's still touristy, but the hidden eateries, drinkeries, the \"cut loose and have fun\" attitude, and the growing artsy feel turn this place into a really fun one-stop package.

      "Already visited several times for both Breakfast and the recently launched Friday Happy Hour, the food which has been universally excellent despite remaining broadly appealing  a testament to Chef Blinn's skills honed at Red Rock prior to taking a chance on the space previously inhabited by Bread and Butter, it was with the Chef taking a needed break to coach his boys' traveling baseball team that two old friends sat down at one of the windowside booths, locally born n' raised Manager Devin keeping an eye on one of the most consistent off-Strip waitstaffs in all of Las Vegas or Henderson.\n",

      "Improving the restaurant soundtrack with each visit, Weezer's Say It Ain't So followed by Phil Collins' That's All playing lightly overhead as the menu was perused, it was with the first of several Iced Coffees from Colorado River Roasters that choices were made, a trio of new Pastries sent out in the form of two lightly fried Cronuts plus a Strawberry Pop-Tart that continues to one-up artisan versions elsewhere by way of being crisp like the Kellogg's original, but stuffed with naturally sweet Fruit without trending over to Toaster Strudel territory by getting over-frosted or soggy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently adding a savory option to the ever-changing list of Kouign Amann, the laminated layers holding up nicely to Ham and Cheese that could have benefitted from just a touch more Salt, it was next in two Brunch specials and a previously unnoticed Omelet that $10.95 to $13.50 was invested, the house-braised Pork intensely spicy inside the fold of three Cage-free Eggs but mellowed by Tomatillo Salsa, Cheese and Lime Cream while the fried Chicken found itself tossed amidst Buffalo Sauce, vinegary white Dressing and Blue Cheese atop thin-cut French Fries and shaved Vegetables that tasted great, and was assuredly portioned sharing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Happily tucking into the can't miss CK Monkey Bread and Jaret's Bananas Foster Pancakes, an improvement on whatever Jack Johnson may have been singing about thanks to the addition of Brown Sugar and Orange Rum Glaze plus house-whipped Cream to the fluffy stack covered in sautéed Fruit, it was along the I-15 that a box of to-go Pastries was investigated, all of these items old favorites and high****LIGHTED**** by the softly spiraled Pecan Sticky Bun as well as Sin City's best Carrot Cake, whether in a full Birthday Cake portion as it was in April or here, made bite-size.\n",

      "***** Better with each visit, and now proving to be just as well CRAFTed even when the Chef is (rarely) absent, anyone who has not been to CRAFTkitchen owes it to themselves to stop in for Breakfast or Lunch, the whole menu offered seven days a week and far better than anything found at The Cracked Egg, Babystacks or Egg & I.\n",

      "Mountain:5\n",
      "To suggest CRAFTkitchen's success was predictable would be an absurd claim, the simple fact that Bread & Butter had failed in the same space while residents of Henderson continually flocked to chains just one reason amongst many, yet from the very first time Jaret Blinn described his concept there seemed to be something different about this place and another packed house on Saturday morning continued to tell that tale.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point an anchor to its Strip-Mall on South Eastern Avenue, a location that friends from the Midwest joked reminded them of \"places you don't want to go\" back home, it was alongside two others that a seat was taken on a day with Chef Blinn away being a Father and Coach, though nothing about the visit indicated anything amiss with every plate beautifully presented and service continually setting a standard that similar eateries should aspire to attain.\n",
      "\n",
      "After thirteen visits something of a regular and ardent supporter of the space despite an hour round-trip from home, the familiar staff and inspired menu more than justifying the effort to pass by several other breakfast spots en route, it was shortly after seating that Coffee was filled for the first of several cups, four Pastries to follow high****LIGHTED**** by Beth Ryan-Small's Tropical Scone and Jaret's Blackberry Pop Tart plus a fluffy and oilless Apple Fritter that outperforms any other in town.\n",
      "\n",
      "Noting the new Vegan Cinnabun alongside an entire menu of animal-free fare, the difference between this Pastry and CRAFTkitchen's traditional Cinnamon Roll barely perceptible save for the size and lack of Cream Cheese Frosting, it was hot on the heels of piping hot Monkey Bread gooey with Cinnamon Sugar that two items featuring Avocado arrived, the ubiquitous Toast better here than elsewhere as a result of Bread baked on-site plus Sunflower Seed Pesto while Tortillas filled with fried slices reminisced of the famous version served at Torchy's in Austin. \n",
      "\n",
      "Transitioning next to two Omelets, others at the table not quite as Carb-centric in their dining plans, it was alongside CRAFTkitchen's daily Carnitas version that a weekly special stuffed with housemade Chorizo and roasted Poblanos was delivered, the heat lent a hint of smoke by way of Chipotle Cream Sauce studded with more spicy Sausage while the pulled Pork made another appearance  later atop crispy Corn Chips as part of Chilaquiles one would be hard pressed to say weren't as good as those found at some of Mexico City's most famous spots.\n",
      "\n",
      "Making one special request mid-week, Chef Blinn happily agreeing to help a guest celebrate in style, it was with a fluffy stack of five Birthday Cake Pancakes available to all as part of the ever-changing Brunch that the meal came to a conclusion...though in actuality the indulgence ended several hours later with three Cookies and one Muffin from the pastry case, two old  favorites as good as ever while the Banana Muffin with Nutella was better this time, though not quite as impressive as the Gluten Free Vegan Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookie that tastes indistinguishable from those made with Eggs, Flour and Butter.\n",
      "\n",
      "*****  Still not slowing down after two years, both the daily menu and weekend brunch in a continuous state of change aside from a few signatures, CRAFTkitchen remains a standard-bearer for how to do Breakfast right and the whole Valley should hope it remains a trend-setter for many years to come.\n",

I simply don't agree, but hey, the only good those comments might do for you if you are deterred from trying this restaurant is the fact that you'll save some money.

Not a fan of bars, beers, or greasy bites LGO offers up a tasteful menu of traditional American gameday fare high****LIGHTED**** by these $1/ea. seared, seasoned, baked to order wings.  Featuring organic chicken, plenty of heat, and just a bit of char what really sets these wings apart is how plump and juicy they remain even without frying and also the dressing - a sort of \"ranch\" with subtle sourness, lots of chives, and big chunks of bleu cheese throughout.\n",
      "\n",
      "LGO Pizzeria Pizza - Half Classic Margherita and Half Roasted Corn with Laura Chenel Goat Cheese, Corn, roasted tomatoes, and basil:  An interesting pie to say the least, what strikes me most about LGO's pizza is the crust - a sort of sourdough starter that the team is making when the place opens at 6:30am and allowing to rise on the counter as lunch/dinner approaches.  Topped with the superior ingredients that LGO is well known for and slathered with a lot of quality olive oil plus a bit of butter the crust gets a great crunch without getting much char and although the oven isn't hot enough to generate the same blister as Bianco or Pomo (particularly as the bakers are opening/closing it frequently to put new pizzas in and take finished ones out) the structure remains supple with a great chew.  Much more willing to go half/half than the vast majority of high end pizzerias these days I found the Margherita as good as the ingredients, though they went a bit light on the tomatoes for my tastes while the Roasted corn was excellent, the smoky sweetness of the corn proving a perfect foil to the punchy chevre.\n",

We inhaled them and used the fries to soak up more of that juicy saucy brothy goodness. I still think about that dish often. We also tried the goat cheese tart, which was super rich and had a very light, airy, whipped texture to it that I loved. For dessert we had the honey almond cake, which was good, but nothing special if you ask me. I'm not huge into desserts, but I felt like I could have whipped that up on my own. A better dessert would have been the mussels--finish the meal on the great note that we started it on! \n",

While an odd request for sure, my e-mail was almost immediately answered by General Manager Andy St. John who stated the chef would be de****LIGHTED**** to prepare the meal during the day at no additional costs, no questions asked.

Water was delivered and I was given a few moments to browse the restaurant before my server returned.  The simple bistro layout, the open doors to the pool and garden, the fresh smell of the baking breads....lovely.  When Robert returned specials were discussed, despite already knowing my strange request, and I settled on a starter of the Chocolate Almond Croissant and a cup (make that about 6 cups) of coffee.  See, the croissant was Breakfast...the Gnocchi just followed closely.\n",
      "\n",
      "The croissant, like all of Keller's pastries, was magical...the best croissant I've ever had in terms of flavor.  Crispy and warm on the outside with chocolate drizzle and copious almonds, plus a flaky interior and a thick layer of chocolate gnache folded into the flaky dough and then loaded with chopped almonds.  If I lived close to a Bouchon this would be a very frequent indulgence to say the least.  The coffee...thick, robust, french pressed...the best priced cup of coffee in Vegas for sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "A couple more coffee refills and it was time for the main course (consumed with water, not coffee.)  Without further ado, I will just say that this dish redefined gnocchi in all ways.  Unlike Italian gnocchi, the French style utilized butter in the noodles along with the potatoes and the effect literally creates a dumpling that melts on the tongue.  Every single piece appeared hand crafted, perfectly tender on the outside, yet toothsome and textural on the outside.  The dish was complimented with carrots, spinach, mushrooms fricassee and beurre noisette as dressing and the entire effect was simply perfection on a plate.  I honestly cannot think of the last time it took me so long to savor each bite of a dish, but by all accounts I believe I ate each piece individually, slowly.  Such simple ingredients, such flawless execution.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly I love foie gras, blue lobster, diver scallops, and desserts considered to be delicacies, but I also appreciate when simplicity yields perfection.  While I've not been to French Laundry or Per Se, both will have their time in the sun in the near future...but for now I will simply state that if it is the little things that count, Bouchon is doing ALL the little things right from superior service to setting to food.  After breakfast I made my second of four visits during the trip to Bouchon Bakery for a carry-along snack...two days later I returned to Bouchon for Brunch, my only repeat of the trip....yes, it was that impressive.\n",

      "\n",
      "Always a Restaurant testing the limitations of its space and clientele, the appointment of Due Forni's Carlos Buscaglia to top Toque earlier this year ushering in the complete overhaul of a Dinner menu that now holds its own against any Restaurant of its ilk while surpassing many 'fine dining' spaces in terms of creativity, it was just past 11:00am on Sunday morning that hostesses led patrons to a lengthy indoor banquet reserved earlier that week, a pleasant young woman stopping by within moments to take drink orders of Coffee for most, plus one Potion for the guest of honor. \n",

      "Once again featuring shockingly efficient service for a place that does so much volume, Mr. Stotland keeping a watchful eye over the expansive space and coordination of servers with bussers seamlessly filling drinks and clearing plates without ever feeling late or intrusive, it was in three courses that Brunch was consumed beginning with HEXX's famous Fruit Plate, the collection this time high****LIGHTED**** by Papaya and Pineapple best dipped in Coconut Whip while the Dragon Fruit was far sweeter than usual, both on the plate and as incorporated into the \"Magick Dragon\" that billowed smoke upon service with a flavor not dissimilar to the Red Icee's served at the movie theater.\n",

      "\n",
      "Sharing all plates family-style, the carbohydrate-heavy first course taking its toll on lighter appetites despite several plates to follow, it was to wide eyes that servers next delivered HEXX's Benny replacing English Muffins with cheesy Potatoes alongside a stacked Breakfast Croissant and Chilaquiles with a lot of spice and several still-crisp Tortilla Chips, plus an oversized order of the typically Dinner-only fried Broccolini.\n",
      "\n",
      "Admittedly a lot of Food, the Parmesan Potatoes particularly dangerous when accounting for portion and likelihood of going back for seconds, it was after a brief respite with one guest already waving the white flag that four all-new Desserts were delivered, Pastry Chef Mirada proving a worthy successor to Carol Garcia with thick Pumpkin Brulee that eats like Pot de Crème with a caramelized top plus a boozy Shake served next creamy confetti Cheesecake and equally rich Marshmallow Semifreddo beneath crumbled Graham Crackers and Fudge made from HEXX's bean-to-bar Chocolate.\n",

Instead I got to walk up to a computer stand, input my phone number, and print out a ticket to come back and pay / wait for my table. 9:02. The time frame was right, but I got to spend the time relaxing and not in line. Presumable this is so that they can let their customers gamble and make more money. I enjoyed the free bench at Starbucks and stayed entertained with conversation with friends. Going back to line around 8:50, they let us in early to pay and sit. I still had to wait a solid 15 more after paying to sit. \n",

I read before over 500 items, which is probably somewhat accurate if you count each individual label for honey and bread. Starting with ramen and ending with hot crab, I went back to try almost everything. Unfortunately I did not get to eat a mass quantity of any one thing, but got to try most things. I was de****LIGHTED**** to actually enjoy almost every dish. Every dish I tried I probably could have eaten as a full course.  \n",

      "I loved the food. My only criticism has to be the price. Were this buffet 10-5 dollars cheaper it would be the best buffet, hands down, ever, period. I feel like you can get a similar level of quality at the M, but at the end of the day the price (and overall quality of food) is better here at Ceasars. I will have to be a repeat customer. It is just that 2013 was the year of the Bacchanal in vegas. My front desk man at the Riviera told me that they even closed their buffet because of people wanting this high quality expensive option like the Bacchanal. I hope that this trend continues and buffets in vegas all come to this quality.\n",

Definitely outstanding customer service! \n",

      "Check-in was fairly easy, especially considering the number of rooms we had. I was able to get everyone checked-in within about 20-30 minutes, which I felt was very reasonable with that many rooms. Because it was very early in the day (around 10:30am), most of our rooms were still being prepared, but the front desk was able to issue keys & then text each guest when their room was ready. The Palazzo also offers complimentary baggage hold service, so we were able to enjoy our wait & walk around unencumbered.\n",

      "My room was simply stunning! I later discovered I had the highest-floor room of my group, on the 42nd floor, overlooking the pools, Vegas Strip and the mountains to the west. What an incredible view! The window had a wide ledge, and I spent much time there, just gazing out at Las Vegas. And this *standard* room was HUGE! Two queen-size beds in the bedroom area that opened to a sunken sitting area with a corner sofa, TV cabinet and a desk. Unfortunately, I did have to use the desk to finish payroll that week, and found the view a bit distracting! But the desk was an ample size; I had no problems with the Wi-Fi, and it did seem to be very fast. The bathroom was gigantic, with a double sink and a separate vanity table with mirror, plus soaking tub, large glass shower stall, and toilet room. As the organizer in the *extra* room, I ended up with a couple of different roommates throughout my stay, each for a night or two, and then enjoyed the room by myself on the last night. On that final night, I managed to find time to soak in the tub and finish a cocktail. My only *complaint* was that housekeeping assumed all the female toiletries belonged to one person, and they occasionally co-mingled my items with my roommates'. Not a big deal, and we actually found it amusing.\n",

The variety of dining options is astounding! I dined at several restaurants more than once, and enjoyed consistent food quality & service each time. On my final day, I was de****LIGHTED**** to have a few hours to relax by a couple of the pools, and was equally impressed by the cleanliness of this area as well. The Palazzo offers several gorgeous pools on the west side of the building, which of course made sunbathing early in the day difficult. I actually had to find another chaise at the south end of the pool deck just to get a little more sun. But the pools were refreshing & the entire area well-landscaped.

Some of the best fries ever! And for sure hard to share since I totally wanted to eat the whole thing myself. I love that the cheese was evenly spread out through out the whole cone of fries, which allowed us to get our fair share of cheese with each bite. The dipping sauce/truffle aioli was also pretty tasty.   (10/10)\n",

      "*Euro Burger $16- Juicy meat, warm soft delicious bread bun, truffle aioli running down my fingers making me lick the goodness off, some goat cheese, roasted tomatoes and arugula for some greens. Goodness gracious! The quality of this burger is so worth the dollars I spent to get to this burger bliss. The burger was a decent size, I would have been wayyyy full if I ate it all myself but we were pretty satisfied with the portion and decided to leave some room in for more alcohol.  (10/10)\n",
      "\n",
      "*Green tea gin- STRONG flavor of gin in this drink indeed! Had a good buzz going on thanks to this baby. The green tea flavor wasn't as strong as I thought it would be.   (9/10)\n",

I thought it was interesting that they offered this service but the photographer himself was very nice and easy going. The customer service of Burgr is truly up to standards. They know how to treat their customers well. They for sure make them feel special and walk out with a happy belly and pretty smile. Would love to come back and get me another burger (maybe the hell's kitchen burger with the jalapeno for the spice and some avocado slices or brittania burger that sounded interesting with mango chutney and sharp cheddar cheese) and my own side of fries to make any Vegas vacation trip an incredible one in my book.

Although Yelp hours have them listed as being open from lunch through dinner, I did notice they have an hour break where they close between I believe 3-4PM.  Luckily we made it there in time for a late lunch.  \n",

      "Admittedly I was so hungry that I did not get a chance to really savor the individual ingredients (apparently that was Brussel Sprout slaw on top) in the crispy pork belly roll as I practically inhaled it.  What I did taste was very good and the slaw does lighten up what could've been a heavy option.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The good thing is after I satisfied those hunger pains, I did get a chance to slowly enjoy my choice of 3 tacos with veggie side which I felt was the best value if you want to try different flavors and in itself would've been enough to satisfy you for lunch as long as you did not come in starving.  Wanting a variety, I got the al pastor (pork), Korean beef, and battered cod tacos with a good sized side of Mexican corn.  The Mexican corn had a nice creaminess to the taste that was nicely offset by the crunch of the popcorn on the top (I do suggest moving the popcorn to your plate when you get it to avoid sogginess).  Out of the tacos, my favorite was the al pastor due to the flavor combination of grilled pineapple, avocado, and pickled red onions that high****LIGHTED**** the pork beautifully, followed by the Korean beef with pickled veggies, with the cod being my least favorite of the 3 as I felt it was too bland for me.  \n",
      "\n",
      "If you get the mahi adobo, make sure to add rice for $2 as the protein itself is on the small side and you need the rice to make use of all the great flavors from the sauce.  The chicken mole with plantains came with a small scoop of rice so was a heartier option and really hits multiple taste buds with this dish, from the sweetness of the plantains to the savoriness of the chicken to the slight but mildly spicy punch of the mole sauce.  \n",

The restaurant is big enough to accommodate large groups.  It's a bit of a maze, so pay attention when you walk all the way to the back of the restaurant.  The staff was once again very knowledgeable about the food and made suggestions accordingly.  They didn't offer sangria, but the waiter suggested a Sangiovese mixed drink that tasted like crushed strawberries.  It was so refreshing and hit the spot.  I tried the veal saltimbocca & bacon-wrapped asparagus.  The veal was salty as it should be.  The asparagus was perfectly breaded, crunchy, and crisp.  My friends ordered the lamb chops with mint pesto, osso bucco, beef carpaccio, seafood spaghetti, la fiorentina, and the filet mignon.  All of the dishes were delicious.  One of my friends ordered the caprese salad to start and we were de****LIGHTED**** that the mozzarella was freshly hand-pulled and creamy.  The combination of tomato, basil, and mozzarella was divine!  Another great experience in Las Vegas.\n",

You can't be in Vegas without glancing over and being de****LIGHTED**** by the dancing water.  The variety of music is pleasant. The fountains dance to the different music so it's always different.  During hot summer days the added water in the air lowers the Vegas heat around the fountain. \n",
      "     This last visit a new experience. I didn't wait around for the next show but I did stop over and watch a layer of slow moving fog graze the top of the pool. That was cool in a weird eerie way. Like a gigantic fog machine was turned on. Never seen that before at the fountain.  Also never saw anyone Jetski in there except Bruno Mars for his 24 karat Magic video.  At least Jesse J was nice enough to walk along the left side of the fountains respectfully ha! \n",
      "     Best place to view from an eagle eye vantage point. Go up the  Eiffel tower at Paris in the evening or if you happen to get a room at the Bellagio facing the fountain. Other than that anywhere along the perimeter of the fountain is a good general place at any given time. Or have a meal at one of the Belaggio restaraunts that overlook it. Sometimes across the street is a better view. You can see the entire width of show without the crowds. If you are in one of the enclaves you are looking straight up. It's like sitting up close at the movie theatres. It's sometimes best to take a step back to see the entire width. In Vegas or going? Spend sometime in the evening watching the fountains.

      "The dining area is dimly lit - good for blurring imperfections from your date or business partner, but not so great for pictures. It's also the place where you get the feeling that the waiters would silently be judging you for being on your phone anyways. A glass or two of wine certainly complements any meal here, so take your pick from the wine menu. If you're on a budget (which probably shouldn't be used in the same sentence as \"I'm dining at L'Albatros\", but whatever), some wines are available by the half-bottle, which we chose to split. \n",

      "I had a hard time ignoring the regular dinner offerings in favor of the Restaurant Week menu because everything sounded hearty and delicious. Cassoulet, duck confit, a variety of vegetarian and pescatarian-friendly options - worthy of a revisit when my pockets are deeper. For my three courses, I got the Gnudi, Grilled Swordfish, and Lemon Poundcake w/ Strawberry Ice Cream. Gnudi are gnocchi's lighter, chewier cousins, served in a mixture of savory vegetables and mushrooms. I found it a little on the richer, saltier side, but I tend not to use that much salt or butter in my own cooking. The swordfish was cooked evenly through and through, with perfect cross-hatching grillmarks. I probably could have inhaled it all in 3 bites, but etiquette and company demanded that I savor each bite. It was a very balanced dish, the only fault being that I wished the cherry tomatoes were fresher and juicier. The Beef Shortrib dish some of my other friends chose was divine. It was just an hour or so short of being pulled pork consistency; so tender, and a surprisingly large portion. It was served atop goat cheese potatoes au gratin, so definitely a heavier plate which made it difficult for them to finish dessert. I was thankful for the citrus tang of Lemon Poundcake and fresh strawberries to round out these flavors at the end. The Creme Caramel option looked and tasted a lot like flan. \n",

      "While eating we were definitely people-watching, and I couldn't help but notice the cheese cart making its way around. I don't even like cheese, but the fancy display and obvious pride in which the server presented options for tasting for those who ordered it made me curious. \n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout the meal the staff was wonderfully attentive even though they had a packed dining room to deal with. Complimentary bread and olive oil w/ salt and pepper was kept on our plates, water glasses never ran empty, and dishes cleared promptly. There were a few amusing instances of waiters in training awkwardly reaching around to deliver bread or being reprimanded for stacking plates on the tabletop, but it high****LIGHTED**** just how seriously they take the dining experience. Even though the setup forces you into close proximity with other diners, the service made it so each table felt like the center of attention.\n",

Or better yet, try them and you may discover that goat cheese isn't all that bad like I did :) \n",

      "I also tried the Southern Fried Chicken Saltimbocca. So, so, so good. The chicken was perfectly cooked. So juicy. The country ham, Havarti and Marsala sauce pushed the dish over the top.

They have a really nice bar area with TVs and a great selection of local beers on tap and tasty cocktails. Their mint iced tea was a bit on the sweet side for me but I loved the fresh mint flavor.

      "If you want ramen that is on point with flavor and noodles that are cooked to perfection, then come to Momofuku at the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas located on the 2nd floor.  The pork ramen broth was very flavorful, not too salty or oily, just the right amount of that Momofuku flavor.  The appetizers were tasty as well: the soft boiled egg, the pork meatballs, and the Benton ham.  My favorite was the soft boiled eggs which had salmon roe and though there were only four, I could've had like 2 more, it was that good:)  The bartendar, Josh, was nice enough to whip up an original concoction deriving from his Oxnard strawberry roots called \"The Field of Dreams\" which had bourbon, strawberry, and a hint of basil that high****LIGHTED**** the drink to make it a sweet yet light summer drink.  Excellent service (especially to our servers Carlos and Shar), clean restaurant, fun ambience, and cool music to excite the taste buds!

Did I say outstanding....I should have said spectacular or maybe out-of-this-world or simply divine (e.g. as in I was in heaven divine). It was so wonderful my wife and I went two nights in a row (with my mother the second night) and are disappointed that we can't make it three nights in a row. \n",

For deserts we tried the Chocolate Cake w/Toffee Sauce, Caramelized Peanuts, and Peanut Butter Ice Cream, Basil Sorbet and Vanilla Ice Cream. All wonderful dishes with my personal favorite being Butterfish Tetaki, Kobe Beef Dumplings, King Crab Leg, and Peanut Butter Ice Cream. Every flavor you simply wanted to savor, disappointed as it faded but only to be de****LIGHTED**** when the next dish appeared. The food was a true transcendental culinary experience.  Five stars does not do it justice. \n",
      "\n",
      "The service was about as perfect as I have ever experienced. Ryan our waiter for both nights (we requested him the second night) was like a sherpa guide taking us to new culinary heights. Nearly all our dishes were direct recommendations from him catering to our tastes but also helping us explore new tastes. His attention to detail was superb including having a chilled Voss water ready for us the second night, remembering my wife's drink, answering a question about the vanilla ice cream from the night before (yes they do scrap the vanilla bean seeds into the ice cream), bringing us the basil sorbet as a palette cleanser as we had suggested before, surprising us with a dish not on the menu, etc. Charles \"I am a young Wayne Newton\" Tansey III even stopped by to let us know that our disappointment with the chocolate cake (a bit dry and lacking flavor) had been addressed with the chefs especially after having tried it himself.  Charles was even kind enough to walk out with us to the valet. Again five stars does not do it justice.\n",

      "From start to finish, you know you're in for an exquisite experience. Picasso has its own escalator bank that leads you away from all the crowds inside the Bellagio, and as you're greeted, you'll walk through their wine display cases. Inside, there's a large, airy room with large, comfy booths and tables that provide enough privacy for groups large and small. And the artwork on the walls are subtly high****LIGHTED****; while they're not the focal point of the establishment as if you were in a museum, they still provide an elegant backdrop to a lovely dinner. There's even a binder full of backgrounds behind each painting that you can ask to peruse. \n",
      "\n",
      "Service is formal and professional, with just enough attention to make sure your needs are met, without being too intrusive. And, of course, the food was the main event. An amuse-bouche pleasingly paired a sampling cream of potato soup with a pheasant croquette, while the next course, Alaskan king crab, helped whet the appetite further. The sauteed \"A\" steak of foie gras was sinfully delightful, while a decent helping of filet mignon was prepared perfectly to order - medium well, in my case. A dessert duo provided a nice ending to a meal that was beautiful both inside and out.\n",

      "They were busy, like really busy.  That said, they handled it quite well for the first night open.  I'm sure it will be the same for Friday and Saturday, and probably some time to come.  The place looks small when you walk in, but there is a lot more seating upstairs and apparently there is a chef's tasting table downstairs.  What drew my attention the most was this beautiful marble bar stretching down the left side.  The walls were all reclaimed brick that gave it a great homey/earthy feel.  As I walked towards my table I noticed a nice little meat curing locker, good sign.\n",

      "Seated promptly and given our extensive drink menu as well as the regular menu we just asked for water for now.  I'm a beer drinker, but there was so much thought put into these cocktails, that I had to get one.  I can't recall the name right now but something to do with a bird.  It was a smokey/spicy mezcal drink.  Quite tasty.  My date ordered the in house soda on tap, which was sort of like a ginger tonic.  Subtle, but yet flavorful.  Pretty awesome honestly.  As we ran our eyes up and down this extensive but not over the top menu we had quite a few questions.  Knowing how slammed they were we went with the cell phone over keeping our server from being able to do what she needed to.  With a mix of small plates and large, this place is perfect for sharing.  Not necessarily tapas, but could easily be eaten that way.\n",
      "\n",
      "First came out the milk bread.  A must, especially if you order something like the mussels.  Just perfect doughiness, hard to say much else.  Then came the salumi plate.  3 types of sausage, all top notch, with the N'duja being something not quite like I ever had before.  Similar to a soft spicy chorizo, but more tender.  Next we had the Yellowtail crudo.  Simple, but yet amazing.  Super subtle flavor on the fish, lightly high****LIGHTED**** by the accoutrements of grapefruit, fennel pollen, and some type of dehydrated or reduced olives.  Lightly drizzled with olive oil.  Highly recommended.\n",
      "\n",
      "We didn't want all our food at once so we got those 2 plates and then 2 more.  The next round features the mussels and the scallops, which was listed as a large plate.  The mussels were really good, but not quite life changing, like everything else I had so far.  The broth was flavorful, but I needed more toast points to soak it up.  There were some flavors there I didn't recognize, so maybe my palate just wasn't sophisticated enough to appreciate them to their fullest.  Then came the scallops.  WOW.  I can hands down say that was the most tender and perfectly cooked scallop that I've ever had in Charlotte area.  The sunchoke and dashi puree was quite subtle, but I get it, don't overpower the scallop.  An amazing dish, that said I am glad our server told us that it wasn't that big of a plate, because I wouldn't consider it big enough to constitute as an entree.\n",
      "\n",
      "After all this we were full, but not stuffed, so we went with a dessert.  The Sweet Tea Madeleines were great.  A tasty little French cake with a citrus cream and pine.  Just the perfect way to end the evening.\n",

The hostess took my name and started calling my boyfriend Mr. Chan LOL (also he is not Asian so a little weird). However I appreciate the family environment they are trying to create. Jay was our server who made the experience very pleasant- he was very informative, professional and not overbearing. It was brunch time so we tried the short rib hash, portobello fries and steak and fries. The short rib in the hash was killer tender and braised in house. The eggs were perfectly poached on top and drizzled over the perfectly sized potato cubes. This dish is obviously high****LIGHTED**** for a reason. The steak and fries were overly salted but was quickly fixed and perfected on the second serving. The best part of the wait was a complimentary tomato salad that cleared the palate while the steak was grilling. The chef didn't want only one person eating at the table- very nice touch. To make the experience even better, the manager, Xavier, sent out a salted caramel sundae that was heavenly. Who eats a sundae after brunch? Anyone that is served this sundae in particular. I will definitely be back for a dinner the next time I'm back in town. Thanks Echo and Rig :)\n",

We started with cocktails and ordered their 3-course lunch special. Jason piqued my interest with a cocktail called \"Con Membrillo\" that was a Seasonal concoction of quince paste, rum, egg white and nutmeg. There were probably more ingredients in that cocktail that I don't just remember listing.  But, after a couple of smooth sips, I was transported to Madrid's Plaza Mayor in Fall. My husband ordered a Spanish beer, Estrella Damm Inedit Witbier to begin his \"journey\".  Meanwhile, our order of Jamón Ibérico Fermín with picos arrived.  It was a small plate of porky deliciousness that melted like butter as soon as it hit your tongue. The paper-thin slices were paired with crisp \"picos\" or mini breadsticks.  We both ordered the Complete Spanish Lunch that was a 3-course meal. It started with Ensalada Verde (Bibb lettuce, red onions and sherry dressing), Gazpacho estilo Algeciras (classic chilled Spanish soup made with tomato, cucumber, peppers and bread) and Paella del Dia (today's special featured chicken and mushrooms). It was a value for its price at $26 per person. Jason brought out each course in a timely succession...we weren't in a rush and had the time to savor the flavors. The food was well-seasoned and we were seated to watch the chef prepare the paella over the open-fire wood burning grill. We liked Jason's attentiveness, efficiency and positive attitude.\n",

After a couple false starts, I finally got my act together, made a reservation well in advance, and brought a fellow aspiring foodie friend who was visiting town.  We split the bone marrow appetizer, which is three huge femurs and an assortment of toppings, served with toasted bread.  Fantastic.  I chose the special salad, which consisted of roasted Brussels sprouts with candied walnuts and a brisket vinaigrette dressing, and then talked myself out of the Wagyu flatiron (next visit) and into the pappardelle pasta dish that comes in a ragu sauce that was made by angels.  I opted not to get a cocktail and paired it all with a nice dry cider instead.  My friend got the pastrami crusted duck, and she de****LIGHTED**** in it.  We both took ours home for a second meal.

      "Some of the things I loved about the Trump that separates itself from the other 5 Star Hotels in Vegas is that their suites offer more privacy, peace and quiet.  In order for you to get to your suite, you have to go through double doors, which lead you to a small hallway, that leads you to the door to your suite, thus ensuring that you do not hear people slamming their doors, or walking/talking up and down the hallways etc. etc.  I love that each suite has doorbells, so that you don't have to deal with people knocking on your door.  Also, as opposed to the old school style way of placing a sign on your door to show when your room is ready for housekeeping or if  you want privacy, the Trump goes high tech.  In each suite, there is a key pad that you simply press when you need housekeeping or want privacy.  This in turn is reflected on your room number out in the hallway.  (Please see my pic for reference).  \n",

      "Our one bedroom corner suite totally rocked.  It had a really nice kitchen equipped with a Sub Zero fridge, dishwasher, stove, tea kettle, coffee maker, complimentary bottle water, martini shaker, blender, microwave and toaster!  All the comforts of home in a 5 star hotel I tell you.  I loved that we had a roomy living room with a comfy couch and flat screen TV.  Our suite also had two bathrooms (with showers in each).  The master bathroom was AWESOME!!!  HUGE!  With a nice window facing downtown Vegas from the jacuzzi tub!  The jacuzzi tub btw, was huge and could easily fit two adults!  :) Perfect to have after spending a night on the town!  The TV in the  bathroom mirror was a nice touch by the way.  Double sinks, huge shower that can fit like 4 people.  \n",

He sat us at the best table on the patio under the heat lamps.  He was a doll and made sure I was happy since it was christmas and I had brought my whole family for the first time.  My boy was de****LIGHTED**** by the water show every 15 minutes.  Service, as always was amazing.  They had a pre-fix meal choose two items off the menu and an all you can eat pastries, HEAVEN.  Bananas fosters, crepes, cakes, cookies, sugar heaven.  My main I had the salmon salad.  Wow sliced fresh salmon on a bed of greens.  Delicious.  Then i chose the tenderloin and i could cut it with my fork with hash brown potatoes. To top it off $28 all you can drink bloody mary or mimosa.  What a deal for everything.  We were so lucky to experience this place especially on Christmas Day.  And enjoyed every decadent moment.  I can say Lago is my favorite restaurant in Vegas!\n",

I wanted to get here early so we spent a few minutes in the parking lot, not knowing we could've gone inside to wait. Nice long curved couch style seating along the wall (like window seating) facing the bar decorated with a large Christmas tree, complete with wrapped gifts, our little man was curious. We were seated shortly near the massive wine cellar feature (beautiful design). \n",

Bacon-wrapped chicken (delicious), beef flank steak (my favorite, seasoned perfectly, hubby said it wasn't flavorful, but I just noticed it was not as salty as tdb), sirloin (tender), filet mignon (hubby's favorite), rib eye steak (hubby got a huge piece, said it was his 2nd favorite), sausage (our boy's favorite meat of choice but hubby thought it was just ok). We passed on the lamb and pork. Chilean sea bass is ala carte.\n",

Everyone was quick to take our dirty plates away, bring us more side dishes, refill our drinks, check on our satisfaction, asked if there was anything we wanted to request meat-wise. We also got complimentary flan for my birthday (entire month to use it), which was beautifully presented, happy birthday written in chocolate, ****LIGHTED**** candle, orchid, whipped cream. It was delicious. I really enjoyed it.\n",

As a Sicilian, he is very picky about his charcuterie and loved it. Olivier's Mom kindly explained to Dad that Proscuitto does not fare well with panini (heat press) and she was right; it tends to dry out the delicate meat. He also enjoyed Virgil's Zero Cola with Stevia: another testament to Olivier's belief in healthy, organic, non GMO product. As an 80%er in Clean Eats, his breads are the perfect spot to blow that 20% carb wad; reminds me of Baguettes you pick up at market in Paris, perfect combination of crunchy, light and chewy.

Looks like a mini pound cake, but lighter than air, almond flour based and not too sweet. Mom the chocoholic LOVES the chocolate tart, as I do because he uses 80% cacao, giving it a dark chocolate and not cloyingly sweet taste.

      "- mac + cheese: OMG where have you been all my life?! This was the BEST mac + cheese I've had. Creamy, cheesy, gooey. The pasta wasn't mushy, it wasn't too cheesy. It was just so good. There were also bits of kale in this to give you the idea that this is a \"healthy\" dish. Saw right through it, but who cares, just eat it! The only drawback is that there is no way you can finish this in one sitting (it's a bit rich), so be kind and share!\n",

The chicken was succulent and well prepared and I also tried a shredded beef enchilada. Taaaaasty. Portions as a whole are pretty generous and, inevitably, I always leave this place seeking a siesta.

I really liked their take on the grilled cheese with the smoked bacon.  It was a bite sized portion and I was planning on ordering another one.  But then the other items came out...The Bao burgers were also pretty good.  I have had similar ones elsewhere so it didn't really stand out.  The chorizo mac n' cheese was amazing.  Blend of creamy yet savory.  The chicken meatballs were interesting.  I have never had chicken meatballs.  But it worked.  I would order that again. However, our favorite was the deep fried Thai style shrimp.  IT was lightly battered, yet perfectly fried.  I have never had such a well cooked shrimp.  It was paired really nicely with a thai sauce.  We loved it so much we had to order a second one.  The most disappointing dish was the Filet.  NOthing special.

With the infamous Tijuana chain Tacos El Gordo in the mix, the game has now changed ... for the better. \n",
      "\n",
      "Located inside of a strip mall just around the corner of Wynn/Encore, this spot is the perfect alternative to the spendy options of late night spots mid-strip. Folks who are familiar with the Cali locations should notice the mini-spike in prices here from .15-45 cents per item. It's still a inexpensive deal on the Strip and an even cheaper / tastier option that most tacos in NYC. I digress.\n",
      "\n",
      "The late night hours from Thursday-Sunday is often their busiest times here. Lines from post-XS / Tryst crowds of drunken club goers crowd up this small spot. No sense in sprinting to Earl of Sandwich (http://www.yelp.com/biz/earl-of-sandwich-las-vegas#hrid:rCEJrFmkm-Y5nNg1MhO7VQ) when the $10 for a sandwich translates to 4 tacos and a drink here.\n",

      "A true San Diegan Mexican treat - the carne asada fries ($10) are the real deal. A mile high mountain of carne asada beef, salsa, cheese, and crema over fries is terrible for anyone's diet but delicious nonetheless. Tacos of all kinds - adobados, carnitas, de cabeza, orejas, lenguas - are superb in every sense. Vegans ought to look the other way but carnivores of the Mexican loving kind will be de****LIGHTED**** with most everything on the menu.

The creamy silky tofu topped with fish skins and scallions, which we were advised to have with their homemade soy sauce, was so simple yet delicious.

      "\n",
      "Just so you know, the food is served family style. I thought we were going to get small, individual plates of each of the ten courses. Nope, you'll be sharing large platters of the different dishes with your tablemates. Provided that your dining companions are considerate and good about sharing, this arrangement should work fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our first course was phenomenal; I drool as I think of what to tell you next. We were de****LIGHTED**** with the freshest, most beautiful cuts of fish. This is easily one of the most delectable pieces of sushi I've ever laid eyes upon and had the pleasure of sampling. As with all other dishes, the servers provided us with instruction on how to enjoy the dish-showing us the order in which to eat the fish, the toppings to add, and the palate cleanser on the plate. In many cases, I feel people don't get the full joy of eating a certain dish because they aren't eating it right. Raku makes sure you don't commit this fatal error.\n",
      "\n",
      "This superior quality sushi meant that soy sauce was not needed. It would be a travesty, an insult to douse any of these beautiful cuts with the dark sauce. Taken alone or with a little wasabi and you were good to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tofu as I already mentioned was quite satisfying and tasty. Their teriyaki fish was yummy, but not the greatest of all the courses. The fish served in its own broth, head-on was also very, very good. And the magic they created with these grilled tomatoes, served on skewers-had all the girls sighing with happiness. There were two dishes I didn't get to try: chicken wings and grilled beef. My friends said they were tasty, though maybe not the standouts of the 10-course meal.The high-quality rice with fish roe and bits of salmon was pleasing to me, but a bit too plain for the others. Our omakase dinner was, however, mostly a five-star experience.\n",

The tenders were large, we ordered four and couldn't finish them all.  The small versions of the side dishes were also very generous for two people to share.  We didn't want to overdo it so we could order the Buttermilk ice cream for dessert - it was also spectacular!\n",

      "The fourth new discovery that was a five-star worthy dining experience was at Mastro's Ocean Club.  I had heard good things about this place for at least two years, and before then espied its distinctive wooden bird's nest with admiration at its quite innovative and modern design just before the restaurant's opening inside The Shops at Crystals.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the day of our 25th wedding anniversary, and our request for seating inside the nest was granted.  It actually felt like being two young birds sheltered inside a protective nest.  Not only that, but we were surprised at meal's end with a complimentary Warm Butter Cake ala mode, Mastro's signature dessert.  This was a great mouth-watering end to a very memorable meal, as the soft cake seemed to melt in the mouth. \n",
      "\n",
      "But the beginning of our meal was no less auspicious.  After enjoying a bread basket that included large homemade pretzel breadsticks, Diane and I dove into succulent hot Vanilla Battered Shrimp.  These big crustaceans bursting with flavor really deserve to be called \"prawns\" rather than \"shrimp,\" and did deliver a taste of vanilla in the light batter--but not overpoweringly so.\n",
      "\n",
      "For our main we each ordered an 8-oz Filet, which here is called a \"Petite Filet,\" along with 1-1/2 lbs. of Alaskan King Crab Legs.  Both tender steaks were cooked perfectly medium rare as ordered, and with little char on top.  Accompanying Bearnaise Sauce was drinkable, and a Peppercorn Sauce was not far behind.  The hot and long sections of crab legs were pulled out of the pot at exactly the right moment  and presented as already opened legs, so no prying with tools was necessary.  They tasted great dunked in warm drawn butter.  And while Diane praised her large and cheesy Twice Baked Potato, I de****LIGHTED**** in a huge mound of skinny Sea Salt & Vinegar Fries, which was reported to be a small rather than regular-sized version.  Sauteed Mushrooms were lovely, too, but I hardly needed them.  We were stuffed.  \n",
      "\n",
      "With a ratio of about one waiter for every four guests, service was great.  Our knowledgeable and conscientious server checked on us several times, and water refills were regularly poured without any need to request them.  Even with the restaurant packed with guests, the ambiance inside the bird's nest section of the restaurant was romantic, intimate, and classy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mastro's is pricey to be sure.  But, executing well at delivering artfully prepared high-quality offerings from both land and sea, there is a reason why several local diners in the know call this one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas.  Without question we will soon become repeat guests.\n",

      "This time, for dinner, Emeril's employees took it up a notch, and Diane and I enjoyed a five-star dining experience here.  We were initially served an amuse bouche of Bruschetta, Tomato, Mozzarella, & Balsamic followed by an ordered starter of Emeril's New Orleans Barbecue Shrimp that came with a light Petite Rosemary Buttermilk Biscuit and strong, heavy BBQ Sauce.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Diane enjoyed a bowl of Lobster Bisque with Maine Lobster Garnish, I savored the vibrant contrasting flavors of Traditional New Orleans Gumbo with Shrimp & Andouille Sausage.  Then it was time for our mains.\n",

      "While Diane worked on a Petite Filet without char, I applied myself to a 9-ounce lightly charred Filet Mignon cooked perfectly medium rare as ordered, with a large pat of Maitre D' Butter melting slowly over the top.  Both steaks came with classic Yorkshire Pudding, which tasted best after being rubbed in meat juices that ran slightly on the plate.  The meat melted in the mouth, aided by dipping in either a quite tasty homemade Worcestershire Sauce or drinkable Béarnaise Sauce.  I also topped my towering rectangle of beef with a side of Sauteed Garlic Wild Mushrooms, which included multiple varieties.  We also shared a large side of very cheesy and crusty Potato Gratin.\n",
      "\n",
      "For dessert, for us there was no choice.  It was foreordained.  No one makes Banana Cream Pie better than Emeril Lagasse!  One slice of Emeril's Banana Cream Pie was easily enough for both me and my spouse to share.  Together we de****LIGHTED**** in this rich confection of ripe banana chunks set in layers like a brick wall with sweet cement, and adorned with Chocolate shavings, Whipped Cream, and Caramel Sauce.  Mellow Decaffeinated Arabica Coffee served in a French Press just further enhanced the end of this fine meal.  Seating was very comfortable in a half-booth, and service was both professional and knowledgeable. \n",

      "On our most recent trip to Las Vegas, we came not once, but twice to sushi samba. On both occasions the food was out of this world and we were able to experience a table meal and also a bar- happy hour meal. Both were unbelievable and special in their own way.\n",
      "On our first trip, we had Alice as our server and we were blown away. She knew the menu like it was her own and made recommendations for us that we really enjoyed. She came just often enough to check on us and explained each dish as it came out. She spaced all the plates to come a few minutes apart so we could have our hot food hot.\n",
      "We had been here before and this trip only confirmed our opinion that this is one of the premium restaurants in the city. The chef sent out some special dishes for us to try because we were loyal returnees. Yellow tail taquitos were amazing as was the São Paulo roll. The seaweed salad was an excellent way to cleanse the palet and to sop up all the leftover sauces that were so delicious and you didn't want to give up.\n",
      "Drinks were delicious as well and since I didn't think I remembered either one, I'm guessing that the drink menu changes often. The mad Russian had a chu-cumber and I had a lemon samurai if you read this within a reasonable amount of time as its written. Both were awesome- but I'm sure that whatever you try, you'll be de****LIGHTED****, as were we.\n",
      "On our other visit, we brought my sister and chose to eat at the bar. Wow! What an awesome happy hour. We ate just about everything available and went back for seconds on some. Standouts were sea bass skewers and the lamb lollipops. Wagyu sliders we a hit and the rock shrimp left my mouth watering. The Calamari was cut into strips rather than rings and was out of this world. You'll be like us if you're lucky, and try everything. You won't be disappointed. I'm reasonably sure- but don't hold my feet to the fire- that this location is as good at gets- rivaling the location in NYC which we love as well! \n",

      "Ahhhh, the burger craze. New burger joints seem to be popping up on every corner and at some point the beef frenzy will subside and we'll be left with empty restaurants. However, I think Rehab has staying power that would even keep Linsey Lohan here!  The patty and condiment combinations aren't that unique but the ingredients are fresh and the sauces are good enough to eat with a spoon. In fact, I really think it is the sauces that make the burgers here. I ordered a classic cheddar cheese burger which I know sounds boring but it was a great choice as it high****LIGHTED**** the yumminess of the chipotle aioli sauce. As many other reviewers have said, the \"sweet poTOTatos\" (sweet potato tater tots) are good but for me, it was once again the sauce, this time the pineapple teriyaki that made the dish.\n",

      "\n",
      "The interior is exceptionally clean. The way that they decorated the place reminded me of Asian outdoor food stall areas. In places like Hong Kong and Seoul, they have food stalls and there are tables around the area where the customers sit and eat. It's like a food court but outdoors. They also had old movie posters posted in certain places. What was best about this place was that the round tables were decorated as though you're around a huge barrel. In Seoul, Korea, there is this one hugely popular KBBQ joint where your party literally all stand around a barrel and cook your meat. There's charcoal in the barrel and you just grill it. So it's really great that Hobak gives you a little glimpse of that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Before they sit you and your party, they'll prep the table for you. They'll set all the dished down with the banchan and they'll fire the grill up first. Now, this is the best part: when you get to your table, you'll see that their grills are gas based, however, they also put a few pieces of coal there. You'll have the temperature control of gas (somewhat) yet the smokey flavors of coal - now THAT'S definitely different. No other Korean BBQ joint in the city does this as far as I know. Also, the modern ventilation systems! Definitely a plus! The only other place that has it is Doh Korean BBQ I believe. \n",
      "\n",
      "Their menu mainly consists of beef and pork. If you're looking for chicken, seafood, or the huge variety that a place like Gen offers then you're in the wrong place my friend. In fact, if you're looking for AYCE .. this is definitely not the place. Everything here shall be a la carte. Hobak in Korea is largely known for their marinated meats so of course two of their high****LIGHTED**** items would be their marinated skirt steak and aged/marinated short ribs. Aside from that, they also have combo meals.\n",
      "\n",
      "For their combo meals, you either choose beef, pork, or combo. Each combo meal comes with bean paste stew, steamed egg, veggies, cheddar cheese, and dessert. My boyfriend and I decided to go with their family combo: it has two beef dishes and two pork dishes. It'll give us a good round about feeling of the place, their style, and their quality. However, there is a typo on their family combo .. the English part anyways. It says the combo comes with Angus boneless short ribs but it turns out that its supposed to be aged/marinated pork ribs. We didn't realize this until later on in the meal when the meats were out. Granted, if you compared the Korean symbols, you'll easily find the mistake ... \n",
      "\n",
      "I typically don't care for marinated meats so it was a huge disappointment that all the meats in the family combo were marinated. Despite that, their marination was not overpowering and also not overly sweet. They definitely have a good control over that aspect. Their marinated skirt steak was amazingly tender and pretty much melts in your mouth. Their aged short ribs were really good quality. Their spicy pork belly was also a huge surprise: it was sliced thinly like they do for brisket. The pork belly was really really delicious. It just melted in my mouth. Although, I would feel as though the pork belly would be better without the sauce...you'll be able to taste the pork more. I tasted a whole lot more sauce than pork. As for their marinated pork ribs ... it took the LONGEST to cook but it was really good. Because it's not an AYCE establishments, they are able to focus on the pure quality of the meats. \n",
      "\n",
      "The service was phenomenal. Our server was always close by and they actually cook for you. Of course, you have the option to cook the meat yourself and the server will ask you which you prefer. We decided to let our server cook for us. Might as well get some good ol attention here! Our server's name was Sim and he was really really friendly. We had some friendly chats with him about the restaurant, about Seoul, and a few general things. He even would cut some of the char off of the meat if it was too much! Hobak is probably the only Korean BBQ restaurant in Las Vegas to give me superb service like this. It's just unbeatable at this moment. \n",
      "\n",
      "If it gets busy however, I can see how it'll get harder and harder for the servers to be as attentive. It wasn't a full house but they had a decent amount of people dining the night we went. It was pretty good for being their 2nd day in business. But no fear! There is a service button on the side of the table!\n",
      "\n",
      "Being as new as they are, they definitely need to work out some kinks here and there, like fixing the menu. Despite that, my dinner experience was a five star experience here with their service and quality. Especially when you compare it to the other Korean restaurants in the city. Will definitely be back for their beef combo! :) I think everyone should give them a try!\n",

Oh yeah, the drinks are great and are reasonable.  If you like IPA like me, the Green Flash West Coast IPA will melt in your mouth.  They have over 100 beers on tap, so you are bound to find something that you like!\n",

All this with a King size bed and a private terrace with lounge chair.  We loved the bedside phone that controlled the room's temperature and lights (oooh, aaahhh).  The shower was a case in point.  I could have spent my entire stay there, just getting drenched and relaxing.  You could literally fill this shower suite with 10 people easy (okay, get your mind out of the gutter).  Just saying, huge-o-rama.\n",

Compared to the popular chain, Curry House in California, I would say it's a neck to neck competition. Although, my biggest gripe at Zen was that they were light handed when plating the curry - they could of gave us more. We ended up buying an extra side of curry sauce for $1.50. However, the chicken katsu and the pork tonkatsu were both breaded very lightly and expertly fried to a crispy golden brown. They were extremely addicting.\n",

I also tried one of their drinks that had jasmine in it.  The drink was good but if you don't like your mouth feeling flowery then you may not like it. I thought it was cool! \n",

      "Back in the 70's this was THE spot to go before/after prim when it was Bobby McGee's Conglomeration.  Waiters in costume, bathtub salad bar and the best disco !  We loved it then, took our son when he turned 17 (13 years ago) and the place always had a soft spot in our hearts.  Then it changed with the times and became Bobby Q's BBQ.  The hubby and I had to try it after all our times there in high school, college and beyond.  We were very pleasantly surprised at the change and de****LIGHTED**** with the food!  The BBQ us terrific and shows how their slow cooking technique pays off.  I love the fries and the salads are good too.  A nice stiff cocktail arrives when ordered and the service is mighty good.  The prices are reasonable and the portions are HUGE!  The crowning jewel are the hot little biscuit dough donuts like Mom used to make with cinnamon and sugar; served in a paper bag.  A great family spot with rich history.\n",

      "I am not usually one to appreciate Japanese-related fusion food, but after a stellar meal at Uchi in Austin, I know I can be open-minded when it comes to creative cuisine and good quality ingredients.  Service was really amazing.  My server Ashlee was very attentive, gave me great food suggestions, and made it easy for me to be a solo diner.\n",
      "The chefs in front of me were also great - I did not get any names but we had a cross-section of Asia with a Japanese female chef, a Thai male and a Filipino male.  I also met the executive chef, who is Filipino.\n",
      "I received a hot towel to prepare for the meal, and ordered a pot of hot green tea.\n",
      "\n",
      "The amuse bouche: king oyster mushroom \"scallop\" with yamaimo (mountain yam), raw okra slices, yuzu tobiko - a bit hard to pick up with chopsticks so I had to ask for a fork - the raw okra was awesome, and everyone knows I love a good yuzu...anything!\n",
      "\n",
      "Special dish from the chef: fresh (large) cubes of watermelon topped with cilantro, in a lime-fish sauce-coconut cold broth.  When I first tasted this, it exploded with Thai flavors and was more delicious that I expected it to be.  It was a nice gesture to receive this dish gratis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Appetizer: crispy brussel sprouts with lemon chili, mint and puffed rice.  I love brussel sprouts with crispy leaves (I make this at home with basalmic and olive oil) - these were different because they were halved, with some of the stem on, in a powerful citrus-y sauce that was deeeelicious.  I could probably make a meal off of this dish.  A MUST order.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nigiri: I ordered 3 pieces next, the shime saba (Norweigan mackerel) with ginger, scallion and lemon zest; hamachi (yellowtail) with jalepeno miso and cilantro leaf; and the gyutan (beef tongue with pesto).  The hamachi was good but not too fatty...sauce was tasty.  The saba was a star - perfectly cured and the flavor high****LIGHTED**** by the lemon zest.  The beef tongue was SO tender, it was glazed and in the shape on a rectangle, wrapped with a seaweed wrapper around the nigiri, topped with basil and pine nut puree. It was really unique and I would get it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sakana dore: fish of the day (tonight was choice between salmon and albacore and I chose salmon), apple slices, zucchini chips, bell pepper (yellow and red in long shreds), tosaka seaweed, micro greens, and yuzu honey.  The apples really tasted great with the yuzu honey, which was spiked with aji amarillo (yellow Peruvian chile pepper) and had quite a nice back heat to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next for my pre-dessert, I ordered uni, with candied quinoa and tamari.  The tamari is not necessary here because the uni is really some of the freshest I have ever seen or tasted.  I also hate quinoa but the candied nature added an interesting crunch.  I did not like the candied quinoa on my nigiri at Uchi either, but this was still a delicious bite of food.  Normally I end at uni, but I decided to go for dessert since I was doing a lot of tasting.  First, I asked the chef in front of me if I could try the mentaiko aioli served with the toro.  He happily obliged.  It was really delicious.\n",
      "\n",
      "For dessert, I ordered the avo hanimu.  The menu only says \"avocado, lime, peanut, honey\" and Ashlee gave me a brief description, but when I received it, it was HUGE and not at all what I expected.  It has these disks of lime curd? with a peanut-sugar crumble, lime \"chips\" that were like sugar glass, and then 2 textures of avocado - a frozen mousse and a sorbet.  The avocado was really tasty (I love a good avocado smoothie so bring it on as a dessert!) but the dish was a bit disjointed and I wish I had other people there to share it with me!\n",

      "Dinner: \n",
      "The roasted beet salad had fresh greens and nutty flavors with a perfectly balanced acidity. The grapefruit Serrano mule was a delicious compliment. The hamachi crudo then de****LIGHTED**** my taste buds with a nice caviar. The blood orange Margarita shifted us nicely into the short ribs. The meat was tender and melted as you savor the flavor. The Colorado lamb chop was perfectly prepared and had a nutty pepita crust. The mission fig old fashioned needed a bit more fig syrup for me, but transitioned my taste buds for the duck carnitas. The tender duck was braised with delightful seasonings.\n",

There was a 10 minute wait for a seat so the hostess gave us complimentary mini margaritas. There is outdoor seating in the front of the restaurant which is kinda small and intrusive so I was de****LIGHTED**** when we were led to the back outdoor area. It was spacious and nicely decorated. There were several large heaters throughout the patio which kept us comfortable. \n",

The guac was very original: avocado, cheese, onion, cilantro, tomato, lime and pumpkin seeds. It was great. I went with the pork belly lettuce wraps, 3 come in a serving. I think I died and went to heaven, I only wish I had 10 more. My husband got the chimichurri hangar steak. He asked for medium, but it was more like rare. I don't eat red meat that often and the fact that it was literally red turned me off. My brother ordered the mahi mahi tacos, 3 come in a serving. The waited suggested he order a 4th taco because they are on the small side. The tacos were fabulous. He aslo got a side of Tennessee, chipotle grits. They were creamy, smoky and yummy.\n",

Once we told the hostess who we were they immediately took us to our table that already had  menus, place settings, plus we each had our own chips, bean dip and salsa already set on the table! I had brought some cupcakes and the host offered to store in their refrigerator as well. What nice start!\n",

You could even feel the heat! (http://instagram.com/p/jGA9r1jSB9/ ) It went out like a flash and charred the fajitas perfectly. The beef was tender, well marinated, good southwest flavor and seasoning. Grilled onions and green peppers were right texture as well. We each had our fajitas in sterno heated griddles that kept our fajitas sizzlin throughout our meal.\n",

Service, also, is wonderful here, both by phone and in person.\n",

So, I scoured yelp to find a place to eat. I wanted to try the greek place, but their kitchen is being remodeled. So, I decided to order some street tacos and a trio dip from Three Amigos. The tacos looked (from the pictures) like something I would get from a Taco truck in California, which is a plus. She told me 10 minutes, not a problem. I gave them a bit more time because I was moving slow. \n",

Nothing... Then 2 other girls walked behind the counter. I was looking at the 3 of them, waiting to make eye contact and be acknowledged. One girl made eye contact with me for about 15 seconds, then walked away to continue doing whatever she was doing.  I just waited for them to finish what they were doing to acknowledge me, and ask if they could help me.... NOTHING.

      "--Tempura asparagus...they brought it out to me and there were TWO PIECES ON MY PLATE!!!!! OMFG, TWO, 2, DOS? Seriously?! I was done right there, but no, I had to keep going. My friend that was with me owns a fine dining catering company and worked at The Ritz, so I know when even HE says something is a rip off, it's BAD. In fact, our table was going on and on about it SO much that I think they must have overheard us, because they didn't charge me for it.\n",
      "--Next, I ordered 2 Wagyu tacos. Now, she told me they were small. Okay, cool, I'm thinking like street taco size-ish. I am NOT being hyperbolic when I say they were the SIZE OF MY PINKY FINGER!!!!!!! I held it up against my finger to take a photo of it!!! And the best part...THIRTEEN DOLLARS EACH!!!!!!!! And you had to order a minimum of 2.\n",
      "--By this time, you would like I'd just stop eating and cut my losses, but no. I ordered a chicken kabob and a steak kabob. The chicken was overcooked and dry and the steak was so UNDER cooked that I think I heard it moo...blood was oozing. Gross. \n",

      "-4 of the other people in our group gave a \"price point\" of $75 a person and said, serve whatever you want to us...he liked that.\n",
      "-Their \"signature\" dish of black cod with miso was very delicious & succulent, everything else was \"fine\"\n",
      "-Annoying that it was being split between 4 people and they continuously gave portions of 5 or 6. Either give 4 or 8! How hard is that?!...it was like they wanted to start a brawl. \n",
      "-Wouldn't need to return, but don't regret going.\n",

      "Not sure what all the hype is about this place. I'm usually not much of a buffet person but with how much Vegas buffets are talked about, my friends and I decided we wouldn't have a complete trip without checking one out. We were deciding between wicked spoon and bacchanal in the taxi and the taxi driver kept telling us to go to bacchanal. He talked about it so much, my friends and I joked that he was probably a promoter for the restaurant LOL. We ultimately decided on this place just because it was more within our budget.\n",
      "\n",
      "We came with a party of around 20. The line to pay went fast and we ended up waiting about 30 more minutes after that before we were seated. I think the only good thing about this place is that the presentation of the food is beautiful. They put salads in mason jars, chicken wings in little mesh baskets, pastas in mini pots. Everything ****LOOKS**** super delicious, but when you try it, it's completely underwhelming. \n",
      "\n",
      "The first round of food was good, I particularly enjoyed the chicken wings and mashed potatoes. However, I found that as I kept going back for more food, it just kept getting saltier and saltier. I'm not sure if the food started out good because I was hungry or what, but I couldn't even eat the food anymore after a certain point because everything just tasted like salt. Even the crab legs tasted like really strong salt water. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, we definitely should've listened to the taxi driver. I'm sad that my first vegas buffet experience had to go like this and it even makes me hesitant to try bacchanal.

I ordered the house smoked salmon hash with cream cheese and scallions. My hubby ordered the sage fried chicken with bacon waffles. Everything looked amazing when it came out. Then we tasted the food, then we salted and peppered... and salted and peppered again... then salted again... and salted a little more. Then the food became alright... just alright. Darn! My son ordered the french toast and ate it all, so maybe that's a hopeful sign... although he is into pretty bland foods so I'm not sure. The one highlight was the caramel mocha. That was delicious - thick with whipped cream and heavy with mocha flavor! Yummy!\n",

Although the entire staff yells as people enters/leaves, our service with food to our table was only okay.

I like that they offer a locals discount. That's awesome. But overall, I wasn't blown away. The salad I ordered was OK, it ****LOOKS**** great, but flavor wise, I really felt it was lacking. The veggie roll I ordered was cool. I've never seen some of the veggies they used in it. But again, something was missing. I like when your food just hits all the right notes and I didn't think either of my dishes did that. The service is eh. Nothing amazing, but not horrible.

      "After having experienced the Carnival World Buffet disaster the night before, we were a tad bit leary of buffets.......BUT, we had these complimentary passes to any MGM resort buffet, the Aria being one of them, so we could not pass up a \"freebie.\"  Four of us ate an $80 meal for free.  That's good enough for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was a bit leary also because I had read others' reviews, and I wasn't so sure it was going to be anything decent.  The Rio's World buffet was decent enough (for what I wanted), but there was just so much other BS that it was pretty unenjoyable for us.  Here, at the Aria buffet, we were pleasantly surprised.  I pretty much got cold foods like various kinds of ceviche, sushi, Thai salads, cold, poached whitefish, salmon spread.  The ceviches, in particular, were quite tasty, if not spicy, but I really enjoyed them all.  I didn't participate in their halved, ready to eat crab legs.  I had enough the night before.  I also couldn't muster up the desire to eat hot foods, then ultimately stuffing myself......so I didn't.  Plus, I had to save room for Jean Phillipe's pastries.....oh, hell YAH !!!  That was a MUST.  Unfortunately, for me, a pastry snob and baker in my own right, they were good, but they were NOT amazing.  Sorry, but they weren't.  I tasted the banana caramel cake, and it was just banana cake.  Couldn't taste caramel.  The apple rum raisin pie was overpowered by the rum flavored raisins......wasn't a fan.  The bread pudding was my favorite, that, I definitely liked.  I also tasted their strawberry gelato.......quite delicious and packing a strong strawberry punch.  The chocolate brownie was laced with too many walnuts......a turn-off for me.  The pecan bar was decent, but the cappuccino dollop didn't work with it.  Here's the other thing.......downstairs from the buffet is an actual shop of Jean Phillipe's pastries, and THOSE will dazzle your eyes.  THOSE were amazing to look at, and while I didn't get to try any (too full !!!), I would like to think they were better than was presented upstairs at the buffet.  I'd like to know why ALL of those items were not offered at the buffet.  That was a bit disappointing to me.  That being said, all too many times we have all discovered the oh so great looking food item ****LOOKS**** better than it tastes, so while I know to beware of the \"looks can be deceiving\" reality, I just don't know with the store displays...........those pastries are so impressive.\n",

      "I would go back to this buffet again......maybe when I'm in a mood to try hot foods, perhaps more room in my stomach.  However, I would probably hold out for the Jean Phillipe Patisserie downstairs......gotta try some of those next time !!!!!

I love the quirky decorations and the presentation of the food was amazing.  Catered to what girls love, everything about Wicked Spoon was so cute!!!  I love that all of their dishes come in little pans and pots (although it is a little difficult to stack them on a plate.. maybe they should hand out trays instead) so that it was easy to try a little bit of everything.  I've never been to a buffet where every single item ****LOOKS**** so delicious that I actually try everything!  And the taste lived up to its presentation.  Everything was delicious, I couldn't find a single bad thing.  The desserts were soo cute and there was a wide variety of gelato, yumm!  However, the service here does suck a little bit.  I had to ask 3 times to get water and they are nowhere to be found when you're looking for them.

As long as the chocolate is there I don't care. The restaurant even ****LOOKS**** like chocolate. There are pipes all around leading to the bar which has large tubs of milk, white, and dark chocolate. I've wondered if anyone has ever stupidly tried to break those pipes open. \n",

They have kiosks before the long lines where you enter in your phone number and they will text you when to come back to wait in line.

I really enjoyed the meat/BBQ selection...the prime rib was DIVINE. It was cooked to perfection and had just the right about of rare-ness to it. I decided to skip the Mexican section since it didn't look that appealing to me. The Asian food section was impressive. I was very amused as a Vietnamese person that they had pho! The dumplings/dim sum were very decent, I had to refrain from eating more to save room in my tummy. The sushi rolls here were MEH...but the hand rolls were on point.

When the host took us to our table, it was half indoors and half outdoors... as in we were outside pretty much, but there was a tarp above us.. kind of, I guess. Anyway, it was PERFECT!

      "\n",
      "What was once one of my favorite restaurants in Arizona and I craved regularly has officially DIED. I am extremely disappointed that what was once lively, a fun place to visit with its energetic, wonderful staff, great food and atmosphere has now killed itself off.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is with great regret to write such a poor review, yet this is my last time visiting this particular location. The service was non existent from the initial walk in and it felt dead and gloomy. We awaited on a greeting that took its time to come while it was not busy. We were seated and again waited an extended period of time to be greeted and what once was a normal friendly greeting appeared forced and the employees are not happy and seems as though this is a place of \"it's just a job\" and not what I enjoy doing...\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall the wait time was ridiculous. We chose this place 2 hours prior to getting to a concert and although they were NOT busy whatsoever, we waited extensively especially to be served beverages and our meals.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of us ordered the 2 meat BBQ special, it arrived and the pulled pork meatless with nothing but fat and the brisket DRY beyond belief and the meat was very dark as if it may have been in a dry lamp warmer for hours on end, no pull or juices from the meat and beyond well done.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prior to my commitment of my favorite \"live\" crawfish, I always inquire of the size and if it's big, I'll commit. No puny mudbugs for me. I was assured they were big and the server indicated, \"as a matter of fact myself and the staff were just talking about how they are a good size finally\". So, that seemed like a reassured winner to me...I'll take it! However, when they FINALLY arrived to the table, they were just about non existent in size, I could not believe how small these things were as if they ought to throw em' back in to the swamp! This was shown to our server who he too expressed disappointment since on the ticket order he specifically requested large crawfish. I didn't bother eating them and was immediately removed from my order. I was then asked if I'd like to reorder or to order something else. I was reluctant since it took over a half hour to get this disappointing order. \n",
      "\n",
      "I declined on a reorder of the crawfish and instead ordered the ala carte fried catfish, although it was tasty-it was saturated in oil, which made it difficult to eat. I also ordered the favored trifecta sauce with light butter for my shrimp. Again, another disappointment, I am certain at this point the ingredients that were once used when A.C. opened at this location has since then changed along with newer ownership and has now gone corporate. The butter, is not butter and the sauce is of nuclear orange and the flavors not at all the famous trifecta sauce. \n",

      "Surprisingly, I was disappointed by my meal. My friend and I were joking that the water was the best part of the meal because the burgers were so salty. For me, it was the giant deli pickle on the side. I ordered the Dallas Burger ($9) which has coleslaw, Monterey Jack cheese, BBQ Sauce, and pickles. The burger itself was pretty good. I also tried some of the Brunch Burger, which has smoked bacon, American cheese, and a fried egg... but I agreed with all three of my friends who ordered that burger that it was way too salty.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like that you can \"crunchify\" your burger, which just means they add some thin potato chips inside your burger to add an awesome sounding CRUNCH. The chips add extra salt to your burger so watch out.\n",

      "The sweet potato fries ($4) were underwhelming (but the perfect amount of salt) and its honey mustard dipping sauce was super watery and did not go well with the fries. Speaking of sauces, I liked the Chipotle sauce with my burger, but stay away from the Burger sauce, ironically.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, the ****CACTUS**** Pear Margarita tasted... interesting. Maybe it's because I don't know what actual cactus pear tastes like. It looks super cool AND you get to keep the cup, but I would not recommend this drink unless you are feeling adventurous.\n",

      "I had wanted to eat at Mesa Grill for quite some time. I'm a huge Bobby Flay fan, and I know several people who had eaten at this restaurant and told me it was fabulous. So, when we recently traveled to Las Vegas I knew this is where I wanted to go. Unfortunately, on the night we had reservations I had a terrible headache, so I didn't get to eat as much as I would have liked. Ideally we would have tried one or two appetizers, each had an entrée and at least one side, cocktails, and a dessert. However, due to my headache we stuck with entrées, sides, and cocktails only. \n",
      "\n",
      "The meal started with a delicious bread basket. Mesa Grill offers several types of bread, including their signature blue corn jalapeno corn muffins, and each one was delicious; but, my favorite was by far the asiago jalapeno bread. It was phenomenal. I could probably eat half a loaf of that bread alone. \n",
      "\n",
      "We each wanted steak, and would have gone with the filet mignon, but neither of us really wanted coffee crusted, so we both ordered the Black Angus New York Strip Steak. I ordered mine medium-well (I know, I know.. the chef anywhere you go never recommends above medium; but, that's how I like steak and that's how I want it cooked), and unfortunately it came out well done. I mean, all the way cooked through thoroughly well done. In the restaurant's defense I didn't mention it to the server, so they were never aware of the issue, but I still feel like a steak cooked at a restaurant, especially an upscale restaurant like Mesa Grill, should come out the way you requested it. I'm not really the type to make a fuss about food anyway, but on this particular night we had show tickets following dinner, so we wouldn't have been able to wait for another steak anyway, so I just didn't see the point of mentioning it. At that point there was nothing we could do to fix it. B had ordered medium and his steak was cooked to perfection for me. I had a few bites of his, but left mine on the plate. At the end of our meal our server did ask if I would like to box my steak up, but she didn't ask if it was ok or if there had been something wrong with it. \n",
      "\n",
      "We shared the Roasted Corn, which is served with chipotle aioli, lime cilantro, and cotija cheese and the Cilantro Mashed Potatoes. Both of the sides were great. We finished them completely. B had the Mesa Grill Margarita and I enjoyed the ****CACTUS**** Pear Margarita. Again, both cocktails were fabulous and we drank them completely. \n",
      "\n",
      "I really wanted to love this restaurant. I had waited to eat here for so long. But, unfortunately, the over-cooked steak made my meal far less enjoyable than it could have been. If we ever make it back to Mesa Grill I'll be sure to ask for my steak to be cooked less done than I actually want it.\n",

They were actually pretty good, and I'm glad to say I've tried rattlesnake and liked it!\n",
      "For the entree I got the Potato Pirogies with Buffalo Chicken ($25 and there was about 5?)  The Pierogies were good but I don't think the buffalo sauce wen't to well with it. They seemed a little on the homemade side but $25 is still crazy to me for that.\n",

      "\n",
      "Service is fairly good- though you walk up and order, they bring food out to you and frequently stop to check if anything else is needed as they pass in and out of kitchen, which was helpful. At one point, while here with a group, an employee provided table service for additional purchases rather than making us wait in line again for add-ons like extra drinks or sides.\n",

Old School place, been around for 50 years, with red leather half circle booths, red velvet wall paper, dim lighting, old-time professional waiters with grey hair, and expensive food specializing in steaks. You walk into Durant's from the back parking lot, through the kitchen; not because of the light rail construction out front, but because that is how it has always been done. The logo awning and valet parking is back there in the rear! \n",
      "\n",
      "Most steaks are in the $40 range, which comes with a choice of potato styles (baked, garlic mashed, fries) and a choice of soup du jour or house salad (Caesar's Salad is $4.50 more, but it isn't the old school with anchovies or mixed at your table by the waiter with wood spoons like some classic restaurants like this do it. It is mostly just sprinkled with cheese. I long for the real Caeser's salad, not this version remeniscent of casual dining places that serve it with chicken!). Seafood selections are mostly in the $30 range. They offer Delmonico steak (In-Bone New York) for $41.50; the 8 oz Filet Mignon is $40.50 (they have a larger 12 oz, too) and the in-bone porterhouse of 32 oz is $72!  A large Shrimp and Crab Louis entree is $24.95. Spinich dip appetizer is $8.95, and a dozen oysters on the half shell is $24.95 (6 for $13.95).\n",
      "\n",
      "All the food is good, but not fantastic given the prices. Service was very deliberate bordering on slow (from the kitchen , not the waiter). \n",
      "They have a decent wine list. House wines by the glass include the Santa Barbara Avila Merlot, lighter and simplistic, at $6, and the Sterling Merlot from Norcal is $9, with more body but only average. \n",
      "\n",
      "Drinks may default to premium brands if you don't specify at the bar. Myers Platinum rum and coke, $5.50. Tanqueray and Tonic, $6.00. Stolichnaya Raspberry Vodka and Tonic, $10.95. They do serve the drinks very stiff, though!\n",
      "\n",
      "The best thing about this place is the bread. They serve a round loaf of sourdough like bread, sliced and soaked in olive oil and covered with minced garlic and basil. It is free and they will keep bringing more as you wait patiently for your other dishes. We had 3 loaves. \n",
      "\n",
      "They offer typical classic desserts for this type of place, like Key Lime Pie, but we were so full with meat and bread, we passed on it. \n",

      "This is the place you bring your significant other's parents to impress them with a classic, great old school restaurant, especially if they listen to Frank Sinatra and like meat.  But if you are a trendy chic diner, you should pass and try something fresher in ambiance and food but equally expensive (think Scottsdale's overblown newer mega-restaurants which are the new Durant's except with Sushi or Asian Fusion, or oversized Southwest flavored creations with names taken from ****CACTUS**** varieties.)\n",

      "The burger itself was juicy and pretty hefty! The jalapenos in the burger is what made it for me. I'm usually not a huge fan of jalapenos in stuff, but these were delicious! It brought all the flavors of the burger together.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fries were alright, nothing really stood out about them. What was good though was that horseradish mustard dipping sauce! I kept eating fries because of that sauce! If you don't get fries, just ask for the sauce, pretty sure it'll be delicious on a burger too!\n",

      "\n",
      "The Guisado Tenoch & Mexica Ahuacatl were by far my favorites.  The Guisado is terrifically tantalizing to the tastebuds and needed no extra salsas.  The Ahuacatl was equally delicious once I added some Strawberry Salsa. (It's delicious alone, just a little dry w/o the salsa.)  I wasn't a fan of the flavors in the Tlaloc, which were too tart and robust to my liking. Just a personal preference. \n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered my plate with rice and black beans, and I mixed them together.  The flavor of the beans was delightful; they were seasoned perfectly, and not too salty.  (It's my understanding that the refried beans contain dairy, so vegans should stick to the black beans.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Another shining star here is the unlimited salsa bar, which features about a dozen different salsas.  The salsa ingredients are not listed, but after spotting a particularly milky looking one, I inquired and discovered that there are a few salsas which do contain dairy, including the pecan salsa and cilantro salsa.  I have since been informed that the following salsas are all vegan: salsa 7 chiles, árbol, cabo, chipotle, sesame, peanut, strawberry, pico de gallo, jicama, cruda, tomatillo, rábano, and the Mexicana. The guacamole is also confirmed as vegan.  The strawberry salsa became an unexpected favorite, winning me over with its refreshingly sweet and spicy flavors. \n",
      "\n",
      "The service was great and I absolutely adore the wall art.  The only thing I do not like is that the bathroom is in the dining area and several people kept leaving the door open... The salsa bar is right outside that door. As an OCD germaphobe, I was terribly bothered by this.  Aside from that, I love this taqueria and cannot wait to return and try the rest of their vegan menu.\n",

      "I was actually surprised at the quality of beef patties they had here. Even with ordering a medium well, almost no pink in the middle, the patty was soft and moist. The bun didn't look exciting either but it actually tasted great. I really enjoyed the Bobby Blue burger. Blue cheese can be hit or miss and BBP definitely is ordering from the right vendor. I enjoyed the Chipotle ketchup and jalapeño sauce. The burger sauce tasted like a steak sauce. Sweet potato fries were great too.\n",

      "Hanny's was pretty empty for what is normally considered rush hour on a Friday night.  It also gave me the feeling of being in a train station, not sure why exactly.  Maybe it's the color scheme, it's sort of monochromatic with black, grey and a pop of white.  It also feels cold and usually I'm cold when in train stations.  I don't know, that is just the vibe I get.  Don't get me wrong, I liked it. \n",

The only menu items I've tried are from the sandwich section, so it could be that I need to give Hanny's another shot.  I would like to try the pizza, but didn't on this visit because I swear I'd had pizza three times that week.  I was starting to feel like a college student again.

We didn't have much time to spend at the arcade before our show, and we didn't go until our last night in Vegas but the entire two hours that we spent there flew by in a blink. \n",
      "\n",
      "The small parking lot and the two doors held open are very unassuming. Inside you can see tons of lights blinking, as well as the all of the associated noise from a true arcade. I believe that there were 5, (it may have been 6) long rows from the front of the house to the back crammed with machines from new to very, very old. All were in fantastic, working condition. \n",

      "We played a good variety of both older games as well as newer games and really loved both types. We got $20 worth of quarters and didn't even go through all of it in the two hours we were there which as any tourist in Vegas knows is an f'ing miracle compared to the soul-less unsatisfying experience of casino slot machines. I digress - the games were fantastic. The older games were an interesting treat..some with small flippers and 'heavy' feeling pinballs. Most of them were only 25 cents to play; whereas the newer games were usually 50 or 75  cents but the play time lasted much longer. There were two pinball games in particular: Ripley's Believe It or Not as well as the ****CACTUS**** Canyon, which I spent a good  ten minutes each on, as their play just kept going, and going. I guess for me they felt comfortable as far as timing and I did well with them. They had a lot of bonuses and threw in multiple balls at once and were easy to use. I also enjoyed playing some arcade style Mario Bros. which I honestly sucked at - so different from at home play in the early '90s. \n",
      "\n",
      "From the nostalgia of my youth, and back beyond to even my father's youth and probably beyond that, there were so many choices that I really wish we had spent more time here. I could've spend another DAY here playing games, it was that fun. They also had a popcorn machine, multiple candy machines, and sodas. I can't think of a fairer, funner option in Vegas besides the Bellagio fountains.\n",

We were at the table maybe two minutes before our server (the amazing Encina) came over with our menus and a mouth-watering description of the night's specials. We were taken aback by the amazing service and care, not only because Encina and the rest of the staff care about their food and their customers but also because Lillie's Noodle House and Grotto Ristorante at the Golden nugget were such a shit-show with their horrific excuses for service (see those reviews for why).\n",
      "\n",
      "She gave us a few minutes to peruse the drink menu and came back with waters before taking our order. We couldn't resist asking for her favorite appetizers and ended up getting two AMAZING appetizers:\n",
      "-Roasted Corn Soup: the soup itself is light and sweet, a delicious puree of sweet corn.  It came out warm and had a slight bit of heat that lingered in your mouth. It was perfectly seasoned and a great way to begin our meal.\n",
      "-Chicken and Black Bean Quesadilla: It's a great appetizer for four or two. The tortilla was crispy and had a little char to it. Inside, the cheese and meat mingled amazingly. On top, the cotija and quacamole beckoned us to the plate like Sirens.\n",
      "\n",
      "We got our drinks and commented on how the meal was batting-a-thousand so far.\n",
      "White Peach Margarita (my friend and one of my brothers): the sweetest of the bunch. Tasty and light; great balance between the tequila and white peach flavors.\n",
      "Cadillac Margarita (my other brother): I like to taste my alcohol when I'm drinking and a Caddy guarantees that I will. This was a great margarita!\n",
      "****CACTUS**** Pear Margarita (my drink): I ordered this one because of the rave reviews on Yelp and it didn't disappoint. It wasn't too sweet and packed a nice punch. The flavor was great.\n",
      "\n",
      "Encina was back within ten minutes to take our orders. Here's what we got (and loved):\n",
      "-Mango and Spice Crusted Tuna: good God almighty this was good (for an agnostic guy to say this is saying something)!!! The tuna was cooked perfectly. The spicy sear on the outside was enough of a crunch to perfectly contrast the tender tuna. The mango glaze the accompanied the fish was sweet enough to enhance the fish without being too sweet or overpowering. The pine-nut cous cous was soft and delicious. The green and red peppercorn sauces on the plate were the perfect accent. The peppercorns were a soft burst of peppery goodness.\n",
      "-Sixteen Spice Chicken: although not the route I would have gone, this was really good. For those who want to play it safe. The chicken was tender and the sixteen spices were definitely a party in my mouth, but chicken just isn't adventurous for me. My brother loved it; we both agreed that the spiciness level was great.\n",
      "-Coffee Rubbed Filet Mignon: The meat was incredibly tender and juicy. The rub on the outside could very well be the best thing ever put onto a piece of meat. The coffee shined through enough that you knew it was there, but didn't take over the dish. The mushroom-ancho chile sauce was the perfect sauce.\n",
      "-Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops: these were incredible!!! The spices were just right and the meat was tender. The garlic tamale was delicious as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Encina checked on us throughout the meal and kept us laughing. Once we were done, she put down the drink menu and the desert menu and said, \"Now, I know you're not leaving without another drink and some desert!\" She knew us too well!!! Here's the grand finale:\n",
      "-Pomegranate martini (friend): Light on pomegranate taste. Tasted a little cough-syrupy. She was not impressed, but our tastebuds may have needed a nap after the amazing dinner we had.\n",
      "-Mesa Pisco Sour: very nice! The alcohol shone through without being too much.\n",
      "-Mango Buttermilk Upside Down Cake: not enough to share for more than two, but I was really the only one who wanted desert so it was perfect for everyone to have a taste. The cake was nice, light, and warm. The caramel rum sauce was fantastic and the mango ice cream was great.\n",
      "\n",
      "We got to talking about how it was my birthday. At another table, I guess Encina heard us. She said, \"I wasn't eavesdropping or anything, but did I hear a birthday over here?\" They pointed to me and she replied, \"OK. Don't go anywhere\" and sprinted across the restaurant. She came back, told me to close my eyes as she lit a candle and placed it in a small ramekin of their homemade vanilla-bean whipped cream (best ever!). She told me to make a wish before I opened my eyes and said, \"From my heart, happy birthday.\" It was one of the nicest restaurant birthdays I've ever had.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, we couldn't have been happier with dropping close to $300 on a dinner for four. The food was amazing! The service was spectacular. Encina is incredibly sweet and takes care of you. She took the absolute best care of us.\n",

      "Mountain:5\n",
      "Talk about diamond in the rough!! This place is the absolute ultimate destination for pinball wizards and kids at heart alike. If you want the Las Vegas lights, bells, chimes, and clinking coins without losing your shirt, pay a visit to the Pinball Hall of Fame. \n",
      "\n",
      "Traveling from the strip, it will be about a $15-$20 cab ride to the Pinball HOF. Be prepared to give your taxi driver the address, since it is off-strip. If you cab there, plan to Uber or Lyft back. Catching a cab from this location is impossible, and when we've called for one in the past it has taken over 40 minutes. \n",
      "\n",
      "Don't let the name of the place fool you. If you're expecting a museum, or a showcase, with bright lights and souped up pins...that is not what you'll find here. On the outside, the place is run-down and dirty, and the signage is extremely plain. Look for a big faded yellow sign. Inside, it's a warehouse full of games. It's dark and a little grimy.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the PINS.... wow. They probably have at least 150 machines. Almost every pinball machine you could want to play is available, including some of the more rare or hard-to-find machines like Medieval Madness and ****CACTUS**** Canyon. They have a few machines that are one of a few only put into production, such as the elusive Pinball Circus which is an absolute must-play. They have both older machines and newer machines (Wizard of Oz, Game of Thrones, etc.). There really is something for everyone here. \n",
      "\n",
      "Most machines are 50 cents for 3 balls, some of the nicer, rarer, or newer machines are 75 cents for 5 balls. Depending on how much of a wizard you are, your money may last you quite a long time with replays. Two of us played for about 2 hours on $20, but my husband is great at pinball. \n",
      "\n",
      "They generally take great care of the machines; I find that all the pins play very fast (well-waxed). Several of the machines have been upgraded with Color DMD display, which is nice to see in-person. However, none of the machines are truly restored/upgraded in the style of that many collectors keep their personal pins. I did play a few machines that had some minor issues, but still playable. Machines with real problems are taken out of commission until they can be fixed (including on this last visit, Bugs Bunny Birthday Party, which is a personal favorite). \n",
      "\n",
      "The only notable machines we could think of that were missing on our last visit were Whirlwind,  Earthquake, and Jackbot. Outside of those two, all the other machines we could think of were there. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to pinball machine, there are some other retro arcade games available as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've been to a bunch of other pinball destinations around the country (One Up, Modern Pinball, Seattle Pinball Museum, etc. and although this one may not have the glam (or alcohol) that those offer, for a real aficionado this one tops them all given the sheer amount of games. Best of all, all of the money put in the machines is given to charity. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'll admit that it's not for everyone - this is not a pinball-focused Dave & Busters or a retro arcade.I It's literally just a bunch of pinball machines shoved together in a space. It's meant to be a place where people can admire these treasures the way they were intended: by playing them! Some minor things, like hand-written signs, gives the experience a \"cheap\" feel. I quickly get past it every time.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Mountain:5\n",
      "One must give 5 stars to this because it's too amazing that it exists.  Obviously, I would like maybe a little better presentation of the historical information that is written in pencil on slips of paper on certain machines with interesting facts.  But the working condition of most of the machines and wide variety and fair prices make this a unique experience for any lover of pinball machines.  Got to relive playing my favorite, Black Knight 2000, and got taken back to a simpler time.  They also have very rare machines.  Also, like that the change machine takes $2 bills, though I did not verify that this actually worked.  ****CACTUS**** Cooler in the soda machine is another plus.  Worth renting a car vs. cabbing on your next trip to get out to this spot.\n",

      "I started my recent experience with the ****CACTUS**** Pear Margarita.  I could have easily kept this stuff flowing.  Before your meal you are also given a bowl of bread that includes Bobby's take on corn muffins, coffee cake and jalapeno bread.  All of it was excellent.  I almost got carried away on the bread and forgot I had a full meal coming out.\n",
      "\n",
      "On my last visit, I had the Goat Cheese Queso Fundido.  It took all my willpower to not order that again, it was so good.  Instead I told myself I had to try something new for an appetizer.  I went with the Tiger Shrimp & Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale.  The taste was amazing.  Apparently it's an item that has never come off the menu since the restaurant first opened.  I could have eaten several of these for my meal.  Bonus points to the restaurant for having the recipe for this on their website.\n",
      "\n",
      "For my entree, I had the Spicy Chicken & Sweet Potato Hash with an added side of Spicy Mango Glazed Bacon.  Very worthy of 5 stars.  I could go on and on, but I think you already get the picture that I really enjoy the food here.\n",

No worries he made one quick call to verify we were booked for the correct date and such. While he was on hold he offered us an upgrade so instead of staying in their regular tower we would be in the fantasy tower (King size bed,Minibar,Jacuzzi Tub,Aveda Bath Products,Bose Sound System,In-Room Refreshment Center,Separate living room).  We decided to upgrade which was the best idea ever!\n",

Walking into our suite i think my jaw hit the floor about a hundred times just looking at everything. Just the hallway from our door to the room was huge (i suddenly felt like a little kid full of excitment) Our bed was huge with a bunch of fluffy pillows, the bathroom was huge, jacuzzi tub could totally fit 2 people comfortably!! Couple of added bonus of the bathroom, if your watching TV you can listen to it from an overhead speaker in the ceiling which i wasnt expecting when Minh turned the TV on. LOL i pretty much flew outta the bathroom. When you turn off the light in the bathroom it doesnt turn totally off, instead it dims for a nightlight (good thing i might get lost here).\n",

The Pobalano rice is phenomenal!\n",

      "On my last LMC adventure, I thought I would try something REALLY different.  \"El Molcajete\" is the prehistoric version of the popular flaming fajitas. Primal but even more delicious, it comes in a smoldering bowl which looks like it was made out of volcanic stone.  A slab of tender carne asada, cheese, ranchero sauce, with shrimp.

      "My wife and I actually made the two-plus hour drive from Cleveland with the sole purpose of giving the famous Primanti Brothers a try. We've heard about it from friends, we've seen it on the Food Network and we simply had to give it a go for ourselves. \n",

      "Our visit was on a Saturday just before lunchtime. We knew there were plenty of locations for this place but we figured we'd better go to the original. It's located downtown in an older industrial area. For out-of-towners it can be a challenge to find. We managed OK with the help of our GPS.\n",
      "\n",
      "We entered the space which isn't much bigger than most small bars and were seated at the back bar. It's small, there's exposed brick and there are two bars. Other than that, it's not much to talk about. Just about every table was full and the bars were nearly stuffed as well. Our server/bartender was friendly and prompt and not prone to the ****DIARRHEA**** of the mouth that seems to inflict most bartenders. We ordered a side of fries and two sandwiches - tuna and turkey.\n",

      "First, let me start by saying that I get the whole \"landmark\" thing. They've been operating in the same location since 1933. They're a Pittsburgh institution. There's something to be said for a local business with staying power. It just becomes part of the city, nearly inseparable from the location itself. That being said, I've got to comment on the food.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you go to Primanti Brothers you had better be in the mood for a sandwich cause that's about all you're gonna get. Oh, and there are sides, but they consist of everything you already get on the sandwiches. There are a number of variations on the theme, but for the most part you get:\n",

      "-Soft, white Italian bread\n",

      "-Fries\n",

      "-Some sort of base meat\n",
      "\n",
      "For my money, it's just OK. It's tasty and it's filling, but it's nothing to really write home about. I'd prefer a mayo-based slaw and crispy fries, but it is what it is. Maybe it's because I'm not genetically predisposed to have to love it or maybe it's because I can get exactly the same sandwich here in Cleveland at Panini's (sure, it's a blatant rip-off, but I don't really care).  Either way, I wasn't impressed. I had much more fun visiting the street market that was going on during our visit than I had during my dining experience at Primanti Brothers. \n",

      "Six years later, the buffet has suffered. The crab station is lackluster and contains low-quality pieces. The claws are minuscule (they're not even worth getting), and most of the legs aren't fresh. It was very disappointing. We got $10 off the entrance, so I ate my fill of the sad seafood and got my money's worth. Still, I don't think I'll be back. Also, the boyfriend got ****DIARRHEA****.

      "\n",
      "HIGHLIGHTS:\n",
      "\n",
      "- off the strip, no traffic. Close to airport.\n",
      "- A/C worked great, no smells, no rattles.\n",
      "- relatively quiet.\n",
      "- walk in shower AND tub, two sinks and a magnified illuminated mirror, hair dryer and scale to weigh your luggage (or yourself).\n",
      "- crapper has it own sliding door.\n",
      "- super close to the Summerlin Mall and stores such as Trader Joe's. Close to Ikea, Gelatology, Michael's, The Bead Store, etc)\n",
      "- FREE covered parking. Just make sure you park in the hotel garage side instead of the Casino side if you want to avoid a long walk, a mistake we made on Day 1.\n",
      "- Our housekeeper Steve did an amazing job! Make sure you tip daily. If you tip at the end of the week, your housekeeper be off when you leave a lump sum tip. We tipped $3 a day.\n",
      "- Fast check in and check out with smiling faces.\n",
      "- Lots of places to eat and choose from in the hotel with its food court or at Summerlin Mall nearby.\n",
      "- Kid-friendly: nice pool, movie theater and bowling alley within walking distance.\n",
      "- Less smoky than strip hotels. It smelled nice in some sections.\n",
      "- Starbucks Coffee right off the hotel elevators so you can grab n go in the AM.\n",
      "- reasonable rates if you book early. I paid about $160/night, booked 6 months ahead of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "LOWLIGHTS:\n",
      "\n",
      "- I said 'relatively' quiet. While there was no noise from the other hotel occupants, we were awoken in the morning by noisy staff chattering up in the hallways.\n",
      "- no ventilation in toilet, minor offense.\n",
      "- The buffet was very bad and everything was salty. I had ****DIARRHEA**** the next day, not a great combo for dancing in the dessert while already depleted for electrolytes. See above review \"Feast Buffet\" - uff.\n",
      "- the buffet baits and switches you without explaining additional charges (cut in line and pay more, pay more for prime rib, etc) they also make you sign up with your email and phone number for future spam in order to get the special price of the day ($10 buffet Thursday)\n",
      "- covered parking on the hotel side can run out early as anyone can park, not only hotel-guests. There is, however ample un-covered parking.\n",
      "- Take static cling spray if you are sensitive to static shock due to the very dry air. We got shocked daily.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will stay here again without a doubt or hesitation next time we are in Vegas. Far enough away from the strip to avoid the hustle and bustle but close enough to explore if you are renting a car.\n",

I ordered the Eggs Trivette, Toasted Challah Bread, Crawfish Tail Meat, Black Pepper Bacon, Crystal Béchamel, Over-Easy Eggs, Served with Fruit Salad.  The wait was a little on the long side being that we were dining completely alone, but not over-the-top long.  Our food came out and I did enjoy the eggs, but didn't taste much crawfish.  The sauce was rich but nothing said Cajun to me like I would have expected.  Still a tasty dish, but the fruit salad it came with was pathetic.  There was a mix of pineapple which was mostly core, =inedible, some dried up pieces of ****CANTALOUPE**** and honeydew and a few slivers of watermelon.  Who put this together?  It was clearly old and really disappointing for a restaurant that is supposed to be more upscale.  However, overall it wasn't bad, and had I written my review 3 months ago they would have received 3 stars, but I didn't.

Mind you this is listed under their beer list and priced at $4.50, I encouraged him to order it even though he never had it since I've been known to dabble in the sampling of fine wines and beers and found it enjoyable in the past.

Said husband notices a few moments after that this is not what was expected.  I was kind of upset, because I feel that drink had NO business being listed on the \"BEER\" menu if it is not alcoholic and doesn't come out and clearly say that.  Listed next to its name it says n/a.  Well I don't know what n/a meant maybe the restaurant should spell out Non-alcoholic, or put it in the section next to where you order soft drinks.  I was pretty upset, feeling that the bartender should have said something to warn us and just really wanted to get him another beer.  Well now the bartender is at the end of the bar talking to Donald Trump (waiter) laughing it up and I am yelling over excuse me.  Well bartender makes a half assed attempt at coming down to talk to me.  He starts to walk toward me as Donald must have said something that beckoned him back as I was only in mid-sentence of explaining that we weren't aware the drink was not alcoholic he dips back and turns to Trump laughing at whatever line came out of his mouth.  I said quite loud oh that's nice walk away while I am talking to you?  He just kind of looks at me and Matt says never mind I'll just drink it it's not that bad.  It was that bad and I am not only upset that the bartender didn't alert us of the non-alcoholic (in my world N/A means not applicable, but in this case is very applicable) drink, but that he found it more important to laugh with the other employees than speak to a customer talking to him.  To top it off I heard him insult a female employee about what she was wearing to a very negative tune when another female employee told her to ignore him.  It was very disrespectful.  I fumed the rest of the short visit and asked for the check from the female bartender.  I didn't want to tip anything but knew they probably all split tips so I did so sparingly.

My party ordered and we're off to the races.\n",

      "So we're waiting.....and waiting, and waiting.  50 minutes later, after my Dad took my daughter for a walk and the food STILL wasn't there I informed Adam that I was tired of waiting for my food and he said they \"were doing everything possible\" to get my food out, but they were backed up.  He must have said something to the Manager because he stopped by and by this time it was a full hour after I placed my order.  He explained to me that we were still 7 or 8 tickets back.....I immediately went into \"jerk mode\" and told him that it sounded like poor management to me.  He got defensive and told me that it indeed, wasn't poor management.  Au contraire mon frere, that is EXACTLY the definition of poor management!  When you're menu is 98% breakfast which is more \"custom\" and you're in Ballantyne on a holiday you do either one of 2 things......you staff up, or you cater your menu to some breakfast, some brunch and some lunch which will speed things up and not cause your customers to sit over an hour to wait for their dang food.  He then went on to say that he understood if we wanted to leave!  Who trained this guy?  Was he trying to get us to leave?  He then came back a few minutes later to inform us that we were in fact, only 2 tickets back.  After 1 hour, I was not leaving on principle!\n",

      "Ok, so the food comes after 1 hour and 5 minutes, can you tell I was staring at my watch the whole time?  My Prime Rib hash, I have to be honest was pretty good.  There was a nice amount of Prime Rib chunks, mixed in with onions, peppers and potatoes, there were 2 over medium eggs on top and everything blended well together.  Sweetie had the Lobster Salad also which she said was delicious and she enjoyed it.  My number 1 Child had the 3 pancakes and 1 strip of bacon kids meal.  We thought since my 2 yr old doesn't eat much we could have her share one pancake but the pancakes were basically 1 regular pancake cut with a cookie cutter to make 3 pancakes....VERY CHINCHY IMO.  It was served with fruit which was ok, except for the bad ****CANTALOUPE**** which was replaced swiftly by the manager.  I did notice they charged $3.50 for a side of 3 pieces of bacon which should be against the law.\n",

I finally get to order the lemonade while another guest in our party ordered the watermelon lemonade. It has vodka in it, which I can't drink, but I heard that it was very good. It looked beautiful.

The chicken and waffles looked like a huge portion, but after the breading started to break off of my chicken, I realized that it wasn't as much as it appeared to be. Plus, I wasn't a big fan of the Indiana-style sage fried thing they had going on. The waffles were ok. They  normally cook slices of bacon into the waffles, but we got the bacon on the side. They gave us 4 waffles in our order, but barely enough syrup for 2. The other person in our party enjoyed her hash plate though,  which was a huge portion that came with eggs, a biscuit the size of a small pillow and a few thin slivers of ****CANTALOUPE**** and a few berries on the side.\n",

Out came half a ****CANTALOUPE****, all diced up like a flower (pretty!) with a couple chunks of pineapple stuffed in between. I felt kinda ripped off since I was expecting a bigger variety of fruit. It was really hard to cut into the ****CANTALOUPE**** flower as well and it was an overload on ****CANTALOUPE****. Definitely don't get this...huge rip off. The yogurt side was very creamy and the mint syrup was very light and refreshing though.\n",

The hostess puts your name on the list and then comes to find you when your table is ready.  I can only imagine they do that by writing down a small description of you.

It took about an hour before any food came out of the kitchen. \n",

      "$6.00 fresh berries and fruit consisted of a coffee cup full of ****CANTALOUPE****, fresh pineapple, and one strawberry cut up on top.  It was my son's breakfast and after waiting an hour and 20 minutes for it he began to melt down. Turns out it was just sitting on the pass and out waitress forgot about it.  With no high chair it was like trying to tame a wild, rabid, wolverine.  He finally calmed down after his fruit arrived. \n",

      "$8.00 Tostada was....alright.  The tortillas were nice and crispy and topped with black beans, pork, a refreshing cilantro slaw, and a quail egg.

For $10.50, you get a red waffle drizzled with a cream cheese sauce and your choice of a side (grits, hash browns, or fruit).  I chose the fruit which was an excellent choice.

It would have been much better if they cut down the size of the toast - for example, they should serve 1 or 2 small slices of toast and pair it with eggs and a meat of some sort (preferably turkey bacon or turkey sausage).

      "I feel the Wynn Buffet quality has changed over the years. They only had pork breakfast sausage which I take as a hint of reduced costs. Many of the exciting breakfast items they've had in the past which were very gourmet, are now gone. You have scrambled eggs (yellow), or scrambled egg whites. There's a carving station with Dijon ham which was nice, and somewhat unsightly heaping coils of two sausage types. There's a made-to-order pancake station where you choose red velvet, buttermilk or blueberry as a base with some general options to add. They had a smoked salmon scramble, pizza, Chinese food, unique \"hash brown\" blocks (pretty good), mini Belgian waffles, lemon ricotta blintzes, and tamarind baked fish. Salad bar is sparse with a premixed Caesar. Fruit was disappointing (bowl of grapes, ****CANTALOUPE****, pineapple or honeydew) as I'm used to seeing better options at this price point of buffets (strawberries, blueberries, mangos etc?)\n",

The prime rib was probably the best thing I tried, nice and tender, but the thin slice I got didn't accentuate the cut of meat. The snow crab and shrimp (small) cocktail I usually splurge on weren't the best. Crab claws seemed over steamed as they were stuck in their shells. \n",

Admittedly, the quality of the food here -far- exceeds that at the Paris buffet, but it darn well better be, considering the cost is 60% greater.  Plus, no unlimited champagne (that's an additional charge, according to the server).\n",

They have salad that's already pre-constructed, but because this is The Land of the Free and all... they also have additional croutons, shaved parmesan, extra lettuce, and a vat of caesar dressing so you can mix and match to your liking.  You know... in case their pre-fab caesar isn't perfect enough (which I thought it was).\n",

I've never liked pancakes or waffles, and I'm not ultra fond of french toast, of the three major starchy options, it's the one that I will at least make an attempt at enjoying.  I think that some of my reticence around committing to loving french toast was that I've never had french toast like -this- before.  Light, soft, and ready to soak up the hot syrup and strawberry compote, this stuff absolutely melted apart in my mouth.  Mmm.\n",

      "This review is for a special dinner for a group of around 16 or so at the chef's table in the lower level of the Greenhouse Tavern, so usual menu, presentation, pacing, service, and other factors may differ from a typical experience. It was very good overall, and I'd dine here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our dinner was presented in eight courses, with optional wine pairings. Since there was no printed menu, I did my best to capture the details about the dishes, and I'll present them as best I can. I will state up front that the service throughout the meal was excellent. We were well taken care of, with regular visits from chefs, the sommelier, and other staff throughout. A great deal of thought and planning was put into this meal. With that, here's what I experienced:\n",
      "  \n",
      "Amuse Bouche - Small slices of crusty, rustic bread were topped with a garlic based spread, heirloom tomatoes, ham, and a dash of dark greens (unsure as to the actual variety). This was a nice dish, the tomatoes were very good, the ham was tasty but a bit subtle, and the spread gave a nice background flavor. \n",
      "\n",
      "West coast oysters - Presented as two tiny oysters on the halfshell, on a bed of grated pink salt, these gems were outstanding, and this, from someone who is not typically an oyster fan. The liquor had a distinct but not overpowering ginger note, the oysters had a great texture (not at all rubbery), and there was a pleasant garlic taste. A small sprinkle of the salt made them even better. A definite winner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seasonal melons - Featuring watermelon, ****CANTALOUPE****, bread chunks, olive oil, mint, and feta cheese, this dish was a mixed bag. The bread was probably the best part to me; it wore the oil and juices from the fruit very well, and the feta and mint made a nice contrast. But the melons wanted for sweetness, and didn't seem as fresh as I'd hoped, especially the ****CANTALOUPE****. \n",
      "\n",
      "Pasta - Cornmeal based boccoli or a similar pasta was a great al dente in texture, and was prepared with locally sourced sweet corn, tomatoes, jalapeno puree, corn powder, cilantro, lime zest, shredded cheese, parsley, and prosciutto. This was one of the best dishes of the evening for me, and the pinot noir wine was surprisingly good with it; it was a fruit forward, peppery wine that had good body. \n",
      "\n",
      "Roasted pig's head - Affectionately referred to as \"face bacon\" by several of our attendees, this dish, again, was a mixed bag. On the one hand, it was sweet (thanks to a delicious housemade BBQ sauce), tender, and smoky, but unfortunately, the meat was a little dry, and really needed the sauce for moisture. It was served with wonderful brioche rolls intended to make sandwiches; I did not do so, but the rolls were soft and very good. Some fresh vegetables (bell pepper, carrot) accompanied, but didn't add much to the dish in my opinion; maybe if they had been pickled, it would have made a nice flavor contrast with the pork. \n",
      "\n",
      "Whitefish - Tender portion of very flaky whitefish was served fairly simply with a nice beurre blanc and Jerusalem artichokes. Although the fish was really good, the artichokes stole the show for me. I had never had these before, and they were stunningly good. Notes of coffee, and a nutty taste, a great tooth, and just a wonderful overall flavor and texture, this is definitely something I want to try again. Unfortunately, the wine pairing here was a rose that, frankly, I thought was terrible, and there seemed to be some consensus around the table. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lamb porterhouse - This was the final savory course, and for this diner, sadly, one of the biggest disappointments of the evening. They had promise: A bone in porterhouse, very petite compared to its beef counterpart, with a nice sauce featuring roasted fig, lemon puree, demiglace, and a genmai rice, it all looked great on the plate. Cutting in with my knife, though, revealed that the both the strip and filet were overcooked to a solid medium well. Other diners were fortunate enough to receive a more proper medium rare; upon bringing it to attention of the service staff, I was offered a redo. Unfortunately, the second one suffered the same malady, so we just gave up at this point. The flavor was good, but the texture suffered and the dish simply was not worth fighting through. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ice cream and fruit - Presenting as a bit of a deconstructed strawberry shortcake, this final offering combined a creamy, simple housemade ice cream with fresh strawberries, delicate sponge cake, mint, and a nice mascarpone (I believe) base, and it all went together nicely. A lovely sweet wine of the Sauternes variety was paired with the dish; the wine was fantastic on its own, but when combined with the ice cream and fruit, it became almost bitter. \n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, this really was a good experience, but the lamb dish really weighed down the culinary impact of it for me. Some of the wine pairings were winners, but there was inconsistency. It was nice to be near a busy, upscale kitchen, it lent nice ambiance. This place is definitely worth a try!\n",

      "I'm not sure how many pounds of food we shoveled into our mouths, how many cups of coffee we guzzled, or how many of those fist-sized biscuits we actually finished, but boy was it a lot of food. If you would like to see just how high your food can stack up, I'd recommend the sage fried chicken with waffles (not in the benedict form or the one with a side of biscuits), which you most certainly must disassemble or else your fried goods and buttery waffles of a tower will come tumbling down.\n",
      "\n",
      "None of us in our party tried each other's food, to be honest, because we were entirely famished by the time we got seated, placed our orders, and saw those saucer plates come at us. Forks were in, mouths were a gobbling as soon as our own plates touched down. I can, however, tell you all about the mushroom, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato and spinach hash, which came with the aforementioned fist-size biscuit, a slice of watermelon and ****CANTALOUPE****, and 2 over easy eggs (your choice of how you want those babies done).\n",
      "\n",
      "The hash wasn't a \"hash brown\" (think McD's or Denny's versions) as what I had pictured in my mind. They were the pan-fried type, cut not in thin slices and pieced together as one but thick cuts of diced potato (triangle shaped?) that was not that crispy, especially after sitting at the bottom of everything else on that plate. I was potatoed out after a few bites of my dish (it wasn't like french fries where you can keep going and going..). The toppings were stir-fryed well (i really liked the tartness of the sundried tomato that made the other flavors pop), and lucky for me, there were lots of artichoke hearts. The eggs were buttery and the yolks, which smoothly burst through the whites by the forkful, were perfectly aromatic. The biscuit was soft and fluffy, easily pried open. My gluttonous self would have asked for more butter and jelly if I could, but the waiter took awhile to make it over to our table.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not all that intrigued with ginormous portions, but if I were to venture back, I'd go for the tower of chicken and waffles, one of the gravy dishes, or perhaps a sandwich concoction. I wish their potatoes were more interesting.\n",

Even though they were all tasty treats, I wished we were allowed to choose the type of given pastries. (Since I'm not a big fruit jam person, any fruit based pastries meant stealing the cinnamon roll or chocolate croissant off my parents' or husband's plate instead)! \n",

I had a feeling this salad was going to be packed with dressing. And sure enough it was not only drenched in dressing but with blue cheese as well. You think your are getting a salad because you want something a little light and something with greens but you end up getting one of the heaviest and richest because of all the dressing and blue cheese which is already full of flavor as a small dose. The greens were wilted and not as crunchy because of the dressing. My gf did not eat much of it. \n",
      "_Andy's Sage Fried Chicken & Bacon Waffle Tower. Drizzled with hot maple reduction & fried leeks. The name says it all, as it really came out in a high tower! 3 amazing waffles that were nicely toasted and soft inside, and even better that there were bits of bacon inside. A nice combo of sweet and salty when drizzled with the maple syrup. The fried chicken was okay. I think too much of a thick better and not enough chicken itself. Still great when eaten all together with the chicken, waffle and syrup. The combo is just a sensational flavor that makes you dance inside. \n",
      "_The Basic. Two egg breakfast any style, potatoes, fruit and biscuit (add bacon, sausage or ham). I got this as I did not want too much of a heavy meal before we start the night out. Very standard, nothing amazing. I got egg whites, and although it says 2 eggs I felt it was 3-4.. Not complaining but I've made egg whites many times and it's never that big hahaha. The sausage were good, a bit salty and a tad  sweet, nice to bair with my bland and healthy egg whites. I did not eat the biscuit but the cut potatoes were great and nicely crispy. The fruit was just a slice of ****CANTALOUPE****. You think you are eating healthy but the portions are so huge we basically did family style so I ate a little of everyone's dish. \n",
      "_Pork Ribs. Pork ribs on smashed potato, steamed carrots, green beans  with a demi glaze sauce. I kind of made this title up as I did not see it on the menu so I just described what was on the dish haha. My gf thought the pork rib would be like Park's bbq ribs or Southern or Texas style bbq ribs but it was almost like a cutlet of ribs where there is bones but you can almost cut the knife into it. It was good but nothing amazing, the sauce could have been worked on as it was a bit salty and something in it was missing, it was not that memorable. The smashed potatoes were great with the pork. My fave was the green beans/haricot verts. Very thin and slightly crunchy and the sweet sauce just soaked in. I was not a huge fan of the cooked carrots, very bland and just seemed tossed in to add some veggies and colors. A pretty solid dish overall.\n",

The fruit \"salad\" was just a bowl of honeydew and ****CANTALOUPE**** and one single grape. Maybe I'm wrong, but a salad, to me, consists of a multitude of various fruits and such.

They offered a wide range of food options from breakfast, lunch, and dessert. They had traditional breakfast options such as eggs, waffles, pancakes, and french toast. Along with breakfast they had various lunch options with everything from soup and salads, Asian, Italian, Middle Eastern, and Seafood. They also offered many dessert options from pastries, crepes, and fresh fruit. \n",

We didn't have extra time to spare so we opted to dine inside. The wait was only a few minutes and we were led to a quint table that is inside the restaurant but also can be considered outside since it was next to the huge open area that had a nice breeze and view of the strip. \n",
      "\n",
      "After looking over their large brunch menu I ordered the fruit basket and the turkey and egg white omelette. The fruit basket was half of a ****CANTALOUPE**** cut to look like a flower with mango, pineapple, strawberries, grapes and berries inside. It was almost too pretty to eat. It also came with brown sugar, yogurt and a clear sweet syrup on the side. The fruit was all fresh sweet and ripe. The omelette was a nice size portion with tomatoes and avocado ontop. It was a little bland but the hot sauce I asked for spiced it up. I am not a hash browns fan but theirs are very good with grilled onions through out. \n",

      "I would rate this more of a 3.5.  For starters, the decor and architecture of this restaurant is absolutely breathtaking.  Based in the center of a classy mall, the treehouse area has a unique and interesting view of everything around you.  We went around 9, so no one was really shopping and the mall was pretty bare. I felt like I was in a different world!  For a Monday night the restaurant was hardly crowded and we were seated immediately at a table of our choice.  The complimentary bread was interesting, although there were several pieces that were extremely hard to bite into, I enjoyed the soft pretzel-like bread the most.  For drinks we tried the lemon drop and the ****CANTALOUPE**** martini.  Both very awesome, and the cool thing is that they come with the martini shaker, so you end up getting two drinks really.  I enjoyed both drinks, the ****CANTALOUPE**** one tasted like sweet ****CANTALOUPE**** but strong enough to get you buzzed.  As for the lemon drop, it was soooo cool - they put some kinda sizzling dry ice or something in it so it looked like a volcano when it came out.  I sat there in awe for like 2 minutes just staring at the smoke come out of my drink! Then sipped on it and got buzzed 10 min after hahahhaha.  \n",
      "\n",
      "As for the entree, we ordered the rib eye medium rare, macaroni and cheese, and creamed corn.  I'm sad to say but I wasn't too impressed with the rib eye.  I felt like it was cooked in fire too high - the bone was completely charred.  Even though the inside was medium rare, the outside had bad burnt areas all around it.  And since we shared a plate, they brought out another plate for me, but it was soooo hot that when we put food on it, the oil kept splattering on me!!!  I mean granted it was a nice gesture, but I did not like how bits of oil kept splattering on my nice dress!  So anyhow, despite the slight disappointment in the steak, the macaroni and creamed corn TOTALLY made up for it.  The macaroni came out in a sizzling pan where the cheese would not stop ooozing when you tried to take a spoon full of it off....just the way I like it!!! I couldn't stop eating the side items that I probably would have rather eaten those as my meal rather than the steak itself!\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyhowl, I dont know if I'd come back for the steak, but I definitely appreciated the view, side items, and drinks.  Our bill came out to be $110 for 2 drinks, 2 side items, and 1 rib eye.  It was what we were expecting for a steakhouse at this caliber so not surprised.  I rounded up on the rating only because between the two of us, we shared the leftover mac and cheese and creamed corn the next day and still were satisfied :)\n",

This hash has monster chopped fried potatoes and the corned beef was not little chunks of beef but long tasty strings.  The twist is also the meal comes with ****CANTALOUPE**** and a slice of orange with a sprig of sage in the toast.\n",

I also had the breakfast burrito which has egg, chorizo and pepper jack cheese and smothered with chorizo queso.  So good and filling.  It also comes with lettuce and beans which I told them to hold.  The burrito also comes with slices of fresh fruit (****CANTALOUPE****, pineapple and watermelon) and hash browns.\n",

Anyhoo, we all opted for the summer tasting menu - three courses for $45, or with wine pairings, an extra $25 on top.  We didn't do the wine pairing, but I did get the Bellini.  I heart sweet alcoholic drinks and this was delicious!  The champagne wasn't too dry and the peach syrup was refreshing.\n",
      "\n",
      "For starters, the girls had Caesar salad and I had the grilled octopus with a tomato and olive and capers type of chutney/sauce.  The octopus was really char-grilled, and at times it overwhelmed the delicate flavor of the protein, but not at all was it chewy or rubbery.  Delicious and tender!  \n",
      "\n",
      "Entree - the girls had the grilled skirt steak and I had the salmon.  WOW was the steak delicious.  One of the girls commented how this was the best steak ever - tender, juicy, not too salty, just tasty.  And when I bit into it, I almost regretted getting the salmon - it was tasty!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "The salmon was fresh and delicious.  It was barely seasoned as the pancetta provided enough saltiness and the corn ragu added a touch of sweetness....mmmmm.....I had to force myself to finish the last bite - still bracing the fact that we had dessert coming as well.\n",

      "The sorbet trio was fantastic - ****CANTALOUPE**** tasted exactly like one!  Next favorite was the tiramisu - we found the espresso powder covering the delicate dessert to be overpowering, but still tasting.  And the least favorite was the panna cotta.  I think the girls were turned off by the figs, but the almonds and honey really brought out the marscapone in the panna cotta.\n",

      "The 20oz Porterhouse was a sweet deal especially when they let us split it between 4 people! They even sliced it up for us so we could better share it among ourselves. I asked for a medium rare and this thing came out on the bloodier side which I enjoy immensely, but others I was sharing with did not. I even relished chomping on the T-bone at the end, ya know, with the best feminine manners possible. ;) It should be noted that although delicious, the sliced meat did not stay warm for very long. Our friend's bone-in ribeye was also rather cold.\n",

      "We also went for some sides and shared the cost. I ordered the *Sauteed Garlic Mushrooms* for my share. They give you A LOT and as they should for $14. Among all our sides, the tastiest was the *Creamed Corn Gratinee*. For dessert, we opted out, but the waiters were kind enough to note that there were two February babies at the table and brought out a complimentary dessert with a candle for each of us. It was a simple sorbet with ****CANTALOUPE****, but definitely a nice touch. \n",

I didn't eat any of the meats however my son and Husband enjoyed the chicken, steak and salmon. The chicken was a little too charred but the inside was nice and cooked. As far as the salad bar I actually really enjoyed it, I got like 3 plates.  I really enjoyed the mashed potatoes, the tortilla soup,  the Asian pasta salad, the fresh fruits watermelon and ****CANTALOUPE**** they were super sweet! I also liked the salad and cubed cheese as well as the cheese bread. The corn and chick pea pasta was good too. I'm not a big meat person so it was nice to have options and good options.

We headed over to this restaurant that was close to our hotel, and after a short wait we were seated in this kitschy wonderland. There were so many things on the menu that sounded delicious that it took me awhile to decide what to order. I ended up choosing the french toast ambrosia, and it....was....AMAZING. When I read \"topped with seasonal fruit\", I thought there would be a few strawberries or something on top of my french toast. No, it was a platter full of french toast absolutely slathered in whipped cream, blueberries, blackberries, bananas, grapes, strawberries, ****CANTALOUPE****, and honeydew. It doesn't get any better than that, folks.\n",

I also ordered the Elote and a green ****CANTALOUPE**** agua fresca, which were both great. I thought the elote was a bit steep at 4 bucks, but it was very very good.

      "What's most fascinating about La Santisima is that their three separate locations seem to vary greatly in reputation. There's the one in Downtown Glendale, which receives mostly positive reviews. There's one in Flagstaff, that strangely receives a lot of harsh criticism. And then there's this location, the flagship, which receives an exorbitant amount of Yelp reviews that are mostly positive, with the occasional one-star reviews complaining about their terrible customer service.\n",
      "\n",
      "My feelings on Santisima have always been mixed. It's one of my girlfriend's favorite restaurants based on the quality of their guacamole, horchata, and rice and beans. Hell, they also make some pretty decent tacos to boot. But as many people have stated, Santisima is a primary example of a restaurant that's become incredibly popular, but has failed to adapt their model to accommodate the crowds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait times are very common. Parking is horrid, there's hardly any room to wait inside, and rarely will you ever be greeted upon walking in. We usually have to hunt down a server in order to put our names on the list. What's also strange is that, you might see tons of empty tables inside that are unused, while crowds of people are waiting inside in order to get in. When we were dining there recently, a nearby couple finished up their food and left. Their table was left uncleaned for over an hour - all while a group of about a dozen people were waiting outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've also learned that this isn't a restaurant where you want to spread out your portions. Order everything at once. Drinks, appetizers, and entrées. And as soon as they bring out the food, request the bill. If not, you'll be sitting around here for a long, long time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Santisima's menu is kind of intimidating. They cover a lot of ground. Probably too much, in fact. I usually play it safe and just order some of their street tacos. They're good, but in the last few years with increased exposure to other options, I don't quite consider them to be as mind-blowingly amazing as some people are saying. Rice and beans are very good, however, with my girlfriend always citing how authentic the beans taste in comparison to that canned rubbish most people dish out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many people rave about the salsa bar, as if it's some kind of new, foreign invention that they've never seen before. Yes, people. There's a salsa bar. Any reputable taco place has one. Santisima might be considered a cut above the rest, however, because of the variety available.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered their traditional quesadilla on a whim, expecting the same thing I receive at practically every taco shop in Phoenix. Instead, I received a giant-sized, deep-fried quesadilla with oaxaca cheese and butter flavoring that's more on par with a gordita. I love the cheese, but the breading is a bit too chewy for my taste.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their horchata is consistently referenced by many people as being one of the best you can find - provided that you're into chunks. The drink, which is far superior to the more commonly found pre-mixed rubbish, contains hearty cuts of strawberry, ****CANTALOUPE****, and pecans. In my opinion, it definitely lives up to its reputation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The place has a \"dive\" feel, similar to what you'd find at Barrio Café. Thankfully, they're a bit less arrogant about their prices - so the place seems more of an authentic establishment and less like a yuppie playground. However, watching clueless men unknowingly walk in and out of the \"Catrinas\" restroom always manages to generate some laughs. They've since added a \"Women\" sign above the door to stop this from happening.\n",

On this occasion we were using the Buffet of Buffets pass and I didn't look to see how much Monday morning breakfast was, but what we like about Planet Hollywood's buffet is they have a nice breakfast selection.  I was on some crazy fresh fruit tear that morning, so I got lots of yummy fruit from berries to pineapple to ****CANTALOUPE****.  I also dug into the oatmeal and there were all kinds of great toppings: craisins, almonds, granola, etc.  My husband had an Egg McMuffin on cheddar cheese steroids and said it was awesome.  And of course, we munched through the usual eggs and sausage and bacon items.  They have a nice bread bar with french toast, pancakes, and waffles with a selection of syrup and toppings as well as donuts.

I decided to eat something sweet after a nice big Lemon Chicken Piccata from the Grand Lux Cafe at Palazzo. \n",
      "\n",
      "My friends and I chose the fruit tart ($6.50), the chocolate eclair, the pain au chocolat, and the chocolate cupcake. The eclair was alright...it definitely wasn't as good as the eclairs at Chocolate Swan. The cupcake was a bit too rich, but had a nice chocolate mousse filling. The best one was the fruit tart with its vast array of fruits like cherries, melon, ****CANTALOUPE****, pineapple, grapes, blueberries, raspberries, etc. The pineapple on it tasted like a wet rag, but everything else on it was delicious! I just love tart crust! YUM!\n",

      "We started off with the tomato salad and short rib tortellini. They were both good but not great. Then we had the fisherman's grill and wellington. Gordon speaks highly of the wellington and yes, everything he says about it is true, it's quite magical. However, I do miss the sear or char I would normally get from a steak but the beef was melt-in-your-mouth soft. The fisherman's grill was good and cooked perfectly but there was nothing special about it that I can't get at any other restaurant. Our server really urged us to get a side as well even thought I told him I think it will be more than enough to eat so we went with his recommendation and got the mac and cheese. It was nothing special and made with truffle oil. What did Gordon say about truffle oil on one episode of MasterChef? Oh yea, \"One of the most pungent, ridiculous ingredients ever known to chef\". Even though I don't feel that way about truffle oil, I didn't find his mac and cheese special at all. I've had better at RM Seafood in Mandalay Bay. And yes, we were right, it was way too much food. We never should have let our server talk us into ordering the side. We both had a bite of it and left the rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "For dessert we got the melon panna cotta and sticky toffee pudding. The sticky toffee pudding might be the best cake I ever had in my life. As for the melon panna cotta; while the panna cotta was typical, the melon flavor was really refreshing. I'm a big fan of ****CANTALOUPE**** and watermelon so for me, this was quite heavenly.  \n",

      "We started with their Fruit Bouquet, which I had seen on several other tables. It was a beautifully carved ****CANTALOUPE**** filled with melon, grapes and pineapple that came with sides of creme fraiche, mint syrup and brown sugar. YUM. A perfect way to start breakfast. The fruit was so fresh and the little accompaniments paired perfectly. I personally loved the pineapple with the mint syrup and the ****CANTALOUPE**** with the creme fraiche. \n",
      "\n",
      "For our entrees my bf chose the Egg, Bacon & Cheese crepe with some added avocado on top. I chose the special Benedict of the day which came with spinach, tomato and bacon on a toasted sourdough muffin with a chive hollandaise. We also had to get a side order of the frites, they just looked so good!\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything was absolutely delicious. The crepe was perfectly cooked, really melted in your mouth. The cheese was chewy while the crepe was delicate, and the egg and bacon rounded all the flavors out very nicely. The avocado that my bf added also was a nice touch!\n",
      "My benedict was very good, the eggs were cooked perfectly which is a huge plus. Almost every benedict I get at a restaurant has over-cooked poached eggs, but these were nice and runny. Mmm! They weren't kidding about the 'toasted' muffin though. Mine was definitely a little more well-done than I would have liked but it was still yummy. I loved the muffin because it had a really distinct sourdough taste that went well with the rest of the Benedict flavors. \n",
      "\n",
      "The frites were also tasty. We could barely finish just one order because it was so big. Don't be fooled, it looks all cute and small in that little paper cone but it seems practically bottomless. Keep in mind though these are not typical fries, they are very thinly cut and fried until crispy then topped with a good amount of salt. If you like really crispy potatoes then you will love these. Otherwise, if you want regular french fries don't bother. \n",

      "\n",
      "First course, Cantaloupe Soup: Almonds and Minted Creme Fraiche. I like ****CANTALOUPE****, but not really in soup form. Not overly sweet though, just not for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second course, Grilled Skirt Steak: Italian Sausage Mashed Potatoes, Roasted Brussels Sprouts, and Pinot Noir Reduction with Watercress. This was good, but not a very tender cut in the first place. I really enjoyed the mashed potatoes with the sausage inside though! \n",
      "\n",
      "And for me, Olives Burger ($21): Truffle Cheese, Caramelized Red Onions, and Truffle Fries (+$3). First burger came out MW, sent it back and got a perfect MR. Initial juices pour out front/back, truffle cheese has a tasty bite, and the caramelized onions added a nice crunch! The truffle fries were very good, with lots of truffle oil.  One of the better burgers you will find in Vegas!\n",

Luckily I was able to get reservations for Robuchon as it appeared it was fully booked for the night.  With that in mind, I opted to head there.  After reading some of the reviews, I made arrangements to have the limo pick us up which was nice and was able to see The Mansion at MGM.

The shrimps were large, and I'm not sure what they put in their batter but it was so crispy with a nice tang to it. I also tried some of the Al Pastor Street Tacos. Order this if you want something strong in flavor and charred. The street tacos are also cheaper than the gourmet ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sides:\n",
      "The Guac was chunky and fresh with tomatoes, cilantro, onions, and I think cranberries. The salsas were all average until I tried the jicama one. It's so fresh with the lime and cilantro. Best salsa I had ever had. Each table gets a free basket of tortilla chips. We got two for our table of four.\n",
      "\n",
      "I never had horchata before, but it seemed to be the recommended drink to get. I wasn't a big fan of it. Not that it wasn't good, but I'm just not a fan of horchata in general. The pecans, ****CANTALOUPE****, and strawberries did provide freshness to the drink, but it was too overpowered by cinnamon. The drink is huge at 32 oz.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is only one guy acting as a server, so service can be a little slow. But these tacos are worth the patience. The restaurant itself is a little bit cramped but there is enough seating. There's also one large table for a big group.\n",

      "On a side note, I saw a picture of Guy Fieri on a board next to the salsa bar. He seemed to have signed it with the date 12/14. Future Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives joint?\n",

      "Really great bistro style place in the Paris Casino.  It's on the medium side of pricey for vegas, but worth it.  We went for brunch after lounging at the pool all morning.  I had the bacon, egg, and cheese crepe and a side of fruit.  My wife had a quiche that was both good and enormous (we probably could have shared it).  My crepe was excellent.  The crepe was light and yummy, and the fillings were savory.  Normally, I don't expect much when I order fruit at a restaurant, but all the fruit were ripe and perfect as well.  (I'm so used to getting rock hard ****CANTALOUPE**** at other places!)  Service was really good too.  Our waitress was attentive and friendly.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are near Paris, I would definitely recommend this place.  I want to come back and try their steak frites one day.  I would also definitely recommend this restaurant over Ile St. Louis on the other side of the Paris Casino.  The breakfast crepe that I got there was dry and tasteless.\n",

      "\n",
      "Upon being seated, we each got a starter dish of fresh fruit with strawberries, mango, watermelon, ****CANTALOUPE****, and honeydew and a dish with two fruit empanadas.  The fresh fruit had a mango sauce.  The fruit was a nice starter.  We then ate the empanadas which were quite good, too!  Then began our slow but steady try of almost everything on their brunch menu.\n",
      "\n",
      "The menu lists 18 brunch dishes.  They are all tapas size so you can try many different dishes.  You order two or three, enjoy them, and then order some more.  Here's what I got:\n",
      "\n",
      "Green corn tamale - some wonderful sweet corn with sour cream and salsa fresca.  Behind the opened corn husk was a packet of sweet corn wrapped in another corn shuck and tied.  It was sweet and wonderful!\n",
      "\n",
      "Huevos rancheros - this was a tostada with a fried egg (you can have it cooked your way) with ranchero sauce, guacamole, salsa fresca and cotija cheese.  Another winner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bacon jalapeño PBJ - this is and interesting dish of fried egg, peanut butter, jelly, crispy bacon, and jalapeño all inside a fresh biscuit.  I couldn't taste the jalapeño but the bacon with the peanut butter and jelly was super!\n",
      "\n",
      "Peruvian shrimp and grits - a very nice, spicy sauced shrimp on top of grits.  The grits were thick, almost like mashed potatoes rather than the runny grits you normally get.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Oaxacan pancakes - 3 small pancakes made with Mexican chocolate chips and served with a coffee caramel syrup.  Absolutely delightful!\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Churro tots - round churros filled with dulce de leche and rolled in cinnamon sugar with caramel and prickly pear dipping sauces with whipped cream.  A perfect ending to this feast!\n",
      "\n",
      "The two of us spent 2 hours and 15 minutes enjoying this meal.  We chatted a lot, gossiped some (yes, guys do gossip), and we were never hurried.  Service was very good.  My coffee was refilled several times.  There were a couple of errors on orders where we got something we didn't order or we got two of everything.  It didn't matter.  We just kept and ate the extra goodies placed on our table.\n",

      "\n",
      "It was a beautiful day, and we were seated outside in front of the Bellagio fountains. The atmosphere would have been worth four stars alone, but the food and service were both great. We split a breakfast sandwich and a fruit tray. Both were delicious, and the fruit tray had some of the best ****CANTALOUPE**** I've eaten in recent memory. We also had a couple of mimosas, which were a bit overpriced (but it's Vegas). \n",

      "\n",
      "We arrived for our 5:30 pm reservations. I originally had plans to sit indoors and appreciate the artwork as we dined. When given the option for indoor or outdoor seating, and glancing at the  spectacular balcony view of the Fountains of Bellagio around sunset hour, we did not hesitate to pick the outdoor option. We were seated at the table closest to the fountain and the sight and sound of the powerful and well choreographed fountain shows really added romance and charm to the evening. I glanced over at my husband and wonder if he orchestrated all of this, since it was our belated Valentine's Day dinner. Nope. Picasso was the visionary behind it all. \n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the Menu Degustation and my husband ordered the Prie Fixe so we can try a variety of Julian Serrano's inspirations. I ordered The Blue Period cocktail and I loved it! I loved the inspiration behind the name and the subtle fizz and cucumber flavor. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Menu Degustation\"\n",

      "Maine Lobster Salad - Succulent lobster meat with flavorful vinaigrette, and fresh tomatoes, honeydew, and ****CANTALOUPE****. \n",
      "\n",
      "Pan Seared U-10 Day Boat Scallop - Tender scallop seared beautifully and paired well with the soft potato mousse layer on the bottom. I took little bites of the scallop at a time to savor the deliciousness. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sauteed Steak of \"A\" Foie Gras - Hands down, the best piece of foie gras I've ever had. Every bite presented an explosion of fatty, savory, and juicy moments in my mouth. I still dream of that piece of foie gras today. \n",
      "\n",
      "Roasted Tournedo Loin of Colorado Lamb - Cooked perfectly medium as requested and so tender as I cut into it. I appreciate how the lamb flavor was very subtle and the meat was prepared simple, but so flavorful. The zucchini flower tempura was so delicate and fun to eat. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Prie Fixe\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Poached Oysters - My favorite of my husband's choice of dishes. The buttery sauce and caviar was a new fancy way of eating oysters for me. I've also never had oyster poached and it was really good. \n",
      "\n",
      "Foie Gras au Torchon - Not as delicious as my piece of foie gras but for some strange reasons, the sweet apple tart really paired well with the foie gras. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sauteed Medallions of Fallow Deer - Our first time having deer and it tasted just like steak but with a little gaminess. Cooked perfectly medium rare as requested.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Service was impeccable. I personally thought the service that evening tops several Michelin rated restaurants I've dine at, which includes The French Laundry. Our server was exceptional and accommodating. I appreciate the outdoor heaters and how he was so kind to adjust it several times for me. We felt like the service revolved around our dinner where finished plates were taken away, new utensils arrived, and water was refilled (many many many times) all at the right timing. Everywhere I turned on my way to the restroom, there was already someone there opening the door or directing me. The service really made the evening extra special. \n",
      "\n",
      "There was one table that was getting a bit loud a one point of their dinner and I liked how our server approached them in a very professional and tactful manner. Usually when I dine out and there happens to be a rowdy table, the servers ignore it, and that affects all the other diners. I like how our server did what needed to be done so everyone else can enjoy their dinner experience. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you Picasso for a wonderful evening of food pleasing to the eyes and mouth, amazing service, and beautiful scenarios. You were the highlight of my Vegas trip and I truly hope to dine with you again. Maybe next time, we will sit indoors and not only savor the food art, but the actually Picasso art as well.\n",

      "STAFF: all are super friendly, and always have a smile on their face. Manager came by (Jax) she was nice chatted a bit. Hostesses, our waiter Michael took care of us.\n",
      "They go a little too much into detail about what they are doing; I mean I don't really need to hear a lecture on condiments or what they recommend we do with the ginger or soy sauce, unnecessary chatter.\n",
      "BATHROOM: why? because which bathroom do you know has mouthwash to rinse your stinky onion and garlic chip breath after eating here? They do, cute setup.\n",
      "COST/VALUE: Its moderately priced; some yelpers say its cheap or less than the norm, maybe if you eat 5pcs of sushi and drink ice water. But if you have an appetite, and drink, minimum youll blow is 50/person, so again not high not low average price.\n",
      "FOOD: When I eat sushi, I look at 4 things: 1)quality of fish 2)taste  3) presentation  4) originality\n",
      "Taste ===4.5 stars\n",

      "quality of fish =4.5 stars\n",

      "\n",
      "Heres what I ordered:\n",
      "Tsukijji express: tuna ok, with avocado, just a standard item.\n",
      "Agemaki=deep fried with yellow tail, cilantro and asparagus, very good. Loved the black and orange colored sauce next to it. Actually their sauces are great, each dish seems to have its own one.\n",
      "Mushroom wakame soup=order this soup. has 3 kinds of mushrooms in it, a tasty fish/musroom oily broth just amazing. Liked soup more than anything yes that good.\n",
      "Crudo=candied quinoa (not enough on it though should put a lot more) on top of sea bass, tasted awesome, with bursting cut heirlooms in the mix.\n",
      "Atlantic salmon with citrus slices underneath, I know sounds gross...until you eat it, wowzerz, good stuff.\n",
      "Suika Sakana=favorite and most original item. Who would put slices of jalapeno on top of tuna, then put chopped watermelon blocks underneath it, and make an ocean out of the plate base with basil oil? Just heavenly. Their fruits are super fresh and crisp.\n",
      "Fried chicken bits=only item I didn't care for; chicken needs to be fried in a better method, it was very bland tasting chicken, even with the jalapeno slices and thin onion slices. doesn't taste fried, like the chili sauce they mixed with but doesn't save the chicken. Skip this.\n",
      "Oh, they gave complimentary ****CANTALOUPE**** shot, wasn't crazy about that should be chilled but didn't mind it, nice gesture.\n",
      "Downed meal with 2 Asahi Blacks...excellent beer and frigid as always like all Japanese RR's.\n",
      "If your staying in las vegas, this MUST be on your checklist.\n",
      "Shockingly close, just take (from strip) flamingo and go up to past the 15 N/S ramps, keep going about 1-2 miles its on the left side after decateur, very easy to find, but be sharp. There is a separate lightless left turn that turns you right into the small lot. DO IT, don't think go there, and enjoy a great quiet tasty fruit and funky flavor-infused night.\n",
      "\n",
      "so, bottom line, I give the place for the food 4.5 stars, and the smiling faces make it 5. Minor flaws which are easily overlooked even by a sushi snob like me.\n",

      "My friend and I were part of the VIP group for SPG and TotalRewards.  We were treated to a complimentary brunch at this restaurant right on the Las Vegas strip!\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a seat-yourself event where any table left open was yours for the taking.  The tables were already prepared with a delicious ****CANTALOUPE**** bowl of fruit with sides of brown sugar and mint syrup and a plate of salmon.\n",
      "\n",
      "The entrees were fantastic.  I thoroughly enjoyed the bananas foster french toast - with just the right amount of creamy goodness!  My friend enjoyed the Eggs Benedict, which we read they were known for.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't even know what to say about the delicious chocolate mousse.  I mean really - it was melt in your mouth chocolate with the addition of what tasted like the chocolate crunches in ice cream cake formulated into a little ball and served over the mousse.  Texture perfection.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mimosas served were also quite large - I mean, hey, it's Vegas.... \n",

      "\n",
      "Mountain:5\n",
      "The mistake I made coming here last night was coming alone.  I had looked at their menu and thought I'd do the omakase.  My server, Noemi, explained that omakase was meant for two people to share.  She quickly said, \"We can change it and do it for 1.  How's that?\"  That was quite OK with me and with that a wonderful meal began.\n",
      "\n",
      "After being brought some iced green tea, Noemi brought an amuse-bouche of some thinly sliced pickled cucumber wrapped with pickled papaya and topped with feta cheese.  What a grand way to start.  The contrast of flavor with fruit, cheese, and vegetable was a harbinger of good things to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "My first dish was a grape salad.  It had both red and green grape halves with candied walnuts, enoki mushrooms, and some feta cheese with a light dressing.  What an interesting salad with wonderful flavors!\n",
      "\n",
      "Next came the star of the evening and according to Noemi, the most ordered thing on the Yonaka menu--the sake orenji--Scottish salmon with orange supreme, yuzu tobiko, lemon and orange oil, maldon, and micro arugula.  Salmon nicely laced with fat cut sashimi style on a bed of orange slices.  The tobiko added so much flavor to the dish.  Beautiful blend of flavors with the orange and the salmon.  The sauce was their homemade ponzu and it was superb!\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point, Nodemi asked if I could eat two more dishes or was I too full and should we go directly to dessert.  Rhetorical for me but she was serious. I told her that of course I'd go for two more dishes and she said that it would be one more cold dish and one hot dish.  Next came tate ichigo--sliced Hokkaido sea scallops, fresh strawberry, negi, apricot and strawberry relish, hibiscus salt, Thai chili, negi oil, and strawberry sauce.  (I stole the full description from my friend Amelinda so I'll give her credit!) The raw scallops with the strawberry slices was another example of a different take on fish.  It's no wonder they refer to this as modern Japanese food.  It was delicious!\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the hot course, I was brought a lollipop--a frozen cube of ****CANTALOUPE**** as a palette cleanser.  Very nice touch and very good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the hot dish came.  It was skirt steak pieces with mushrooms, tomatoes, Brussels sprout leaves and some cracked salt.  The meat was a little on the rare side which was good and there were both tomato wedges and halved grape tomatoes.  The cracked salt added so much flavor to the dish.  Now I was feeling full, but there was one more dish to come--dessert.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dessert was the mango cotta, a large round of mango panna cotta filled with mango \"egg\" made from mango purée.  On the other side of some mango tuile was some mango ice cream on a bed of pistachio butter.  Both sides of the dessert had finely chopped pistachio pieces and it was a tremendous ending to a wonderful meal!\n",
      "\n",
      "Service was excellent throughout my time there.  The restaurant only had one other table occupied so it was quiet.  The music was perfect--modern and not too loud.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now all I have to do is get some Yelp volunteers to join me so we can give the full omakase a true workout.  It was quite good of them to allow me to do a lesser version of the omakase with full size dishes of fewer courses.  Very well done and deserving of all 5 stars!\n",
      "\n",
      "Mountain:5\n",
      "I try to avoid doing the all-you-can-eats and buffets.  I never can eat my money's worth!  But whenever I'm in Vegas, I try to make an exception and Goyemon is definitely a place where I go all out.  Skip the skinny jeans and put on that billowy dress with the stretchy belt because we're having half the ocean's worth of fish for dinner tonight, kiddies!\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm Seafood's worst enemy and I take no prisoners at Goyemon!  Goyemon is my ultimate favorite place to go for sushi and it's crazy for me to even say that!  I've taken my brother and friends here and they all go crazy for this place.  Nothing in Arizona can compare.  With uni, sweet shrimp, salmon belly, blue fin tuna, unagi, conch, aji mackerel, garlic tuna, and black tobiko being on their menu, how can I not love this place?  There's so many more amazing bites and everything is fresh [Remember:  fresh salmon should smell like ****CANTALOUPE****!]!  Even with the all-you-can-eat, they don't try to rip you off by offering more rice and less goodies like a lot of other places do.  It just proves how great their work ethics are.  Don't forgot to check out their ever-changing daily specials.\n",
      "\n",
      "Goyemon is a trendy little place and it's nicely decorated.  The wait time can be pretty crazy and they're always busy.  The wait staff is pretty on point here as long as you're nice and polite.  Loud annoying people generally are given much worse service as we've seen first hand with the annoying drunken jerks next to us.  But in the city where clubrats and lushes prevail, I can see how they're just over it.  Stay on The Strip, fiends! Let me just have Goyemon all to myself.  Give me an hour, dim the lights, and don't come in when my stretchy belt is hanging on the doorknob.  NSFW.\n",

I love the Migas - it's become my go to dish - though there are many other amazing brunch dishes on the menu. The hot tea as well is great. Locally packaged. I had a black tea called Passion Plum today that was great. The fresh fruit that was with my Migas (by special request) was amazing. You are probably wondering how I can rave about fruit, but it really was that good. You know how most fruit sides have ****CANTALOUPE**** and honeydew that are hard and both the same colour - white. Not this fruit dish. It was vibrant in colour, juicy and delish! I definitely recommend you hit this place up - I like it better for brunch than dinner actually! This place is on my list of best brunches!\n",

      "I have been to Fleur de Lys in SF a number of years ago and had a lovely meal, so I was excited to try Fleur here in LV. The food, of course, was delicious and fairly inexpensive for it being LV (partially because we didn't eat any land mammals on this visit). For you vegetarians, Keller has thoughtfully denoted a section of the small plates menu as being \"vegetarian\", saving you the guesswork of what actually has animal products in it. In addition, if you are on a budget but want the Fleur dining experience, vegetarian is the way to go as the items generally ranged from $3-11. \n",
      "\n",
      "In any event, we went with:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Fried chickpeas: I'm tempted to whip out my Le Creuset dutch oven now and fry my own little chickpea bites of deliciousness now. They were surprisingly delicious when lightly accented with the lemon wedge accompanying it. \n",
      "\n",
      "- Heirloom tomato gazpacho: Generally speaking, I'm not a gazpacho person. However, if anyone could change my mind about gazpacho, it is Keller! This delightfully fresh gazpacho was poured at the table over finely chopped honeydew and ****CANTALOUPE**** \"tartare\" and topped with watermelon pop rocks! The pop rocks actually retained their crunchy pop even after it had been sitting in the gazpacho for a few minutes. \n",
      "\n",
      "- Fingerling potato puree: This is not your mama's mashed potatoes. It was super fluffy and creamy with no lumps. Each bite just melts in your mouth because it was perfectly pureed.  The truffle jus was a nice touch as well without being overwhelming. Sometimes, truffles in food can be really \"in your face\" and this was just the perfect blend of savory earthiness for the potato puree. \n",
      "\n",
      "- Garlic fries: I have had my fair share of garlic fries in my days and this is definitely one of the better ones I've tried. This one didn't have raw garlic (which can be way too strong) but had a nice roasted garlic flavor to it that infused every bite with garlic but was just balanced enough to leave you wanting more. This is served with ketchup and mayo. \n",
      "\n",
      "- Salmon with horseradish dill cream: This is served medium and was cooked well to the perfect tenderness. There was just a little seasoning on the salmon, but not too much to where it masks the flavor of the salmon. The cream sauce was a nice contrast to the salmon too but I didn't love the cucumber or the mixed greens that came with it. They made for nice decoration but didn't add anything to the dish. \n",
      "\n",
      "- Souffle: This takes 30 minutes to make and I highly recommend it. I'm also not a soufflé person, but this one is very fluffy and served with crème anglaise tableside, along with a scoop of ice cream (forgot the flavor). The soufflé had just the right amount of liquor added to it so you don't feel like you are taking a straight shot of alcohol. It was only the size of the small ramekin, which is a pity because after a few bites each, it was over. I probably would get one per person!\n",
      "\n",
      "We didn't get the affogato but it was quite the spectacular presentation at the other tables. It is Bailey's with liquid nitrogen, which they whip up tableside. It turns into \"ice cream\", which is topped with espresso. I'm all for molecular gastronomy and I definitely wished we tried this out - though I was very full by this point and ran out of room. \n",
      "\n",
      "Service was generally good although not as good as some of the comparable restaurants here in LV. One of the issues is that the restaurant is on the darker side and given that the water tumblers are black, it's hard to tell when a diner has run out of water. With this in mind, we had to keep asking. In addition, perhaps because we came very late in the evening, it seemed like the servers were a little less attentive than expected, or perhaps just disinterested like what other Yelpers have noted.  Another minor quibble I had was that the servingware pieces are very pretty and uniquely shaped, which made getting the food out of them a little tricky and messy. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, though Yelpers have said this is a dressy restaurant, we definitely didn't get that impression here. We were fairly casually dressed (jeans and shirts with sleeves) and there were other diners in tanks and shorts. When we walked by the next day, there were quite a number of people in shorts and polos or sundresses.\n",

      "Great place to grab something quick, satisfy your sweet or savory cravings~\n",
      "Great crepes made to order. You can totally taste fresh & quality ingredients!\n",
      "Love the fresh fruit cups - all of the fruits in the cup watermelon, honeydew, ****CANTALOUPE****, pineapple & berries (packed separately on top  - strawberries, blueberries, & raspberries) are so good!!! \n",
      "If you want something fast & easy before hitting the casino or after - great place!\n",

      "I visited Bellagio on a Saturday evening, armed with 5:30pm reservations.  The hostess was incredibly gracious and gave me a window seat overlooking the lake.  Perfect for front-row viewing of the half-hourly fountain shows.  The clientele skewed toward a very specific demographic -- mostly older Asian businessmen on dates with their (much, much younger) girlfriends or trophy wives.

However, I decided that \"go big or go home\" would be my motto for the weekend, so I opted for the 5-course degustation.  This includes an amuse bouche at the start of the meal and petit fours at the end, so it's really a 7-course extravaganza.  Absolutely everything about my dining experience was phenomenal, and I'm still reminiscing over it with fondness:\n",

      "**AMUSE BOUCHE**\n",
      "A shot of slivered almond soup with a pheasant croquette.  The soup was silky smooth, which contrasted nicely with the slivered almonds.  The pheasant croquette was crispy and light.  Both were packed with flavor.\n",

      "Pan-seared U-10 dayboat scallop with potato mousseline and jus de veau.  Imagine the most perfectly cooked scallop you've ever had, sitting on the silkiest, smoothest, creamiest, and most decadent mashed potatoes you've ever come across.  That's *almost* as good as this dish was.\n",

However, it was my server, Mitch, who really shined that day, making sure that every course was perfectly paced, every water glass was full, and every crumb was swept away between courses.  Another amazing surprise was receiving an email a few days later (from the general manager, Kelly M.) thanking me for my patronage.  I'm so blown away by a restaurant that cares so much about its guests.\n",

      "I wasn't too excited to come here, since coming to Arizona I expected to be eating Mexican food. Now I'm sad this gastropub isn't on the East Coast. I forget the name of our waiter, but he was very friendly and extremely tall. \n",
      "\n",
      "The food was delicious. Here's a rundown.\n",
      "\n",
      "Appetizers:\n",
      "The Original Chopped Salad (corn, couscous, smoked salmon, asiago, pepitas, tomatoes, arugula, currants, buttermilk pesto dressing) - Despite all the raving reviews, I was really skeptical on how good a salad would be. Damn it was good. The textures were party-in-my mouth good. The buttermilk pesto dressing gave it a perfect tang. Do yourself a favor and order this above anything else. https://www.facebook.com/TheOriginalChoppedSalad/\n",
      "\n",
      "Pork Belly Pastrami (rye spaetzle, Brussels sprout sauerkraut, mustard jus) - The pork belly was melt in your mouth, although some off-putting parts were all fat. The brussel sprouts were shaved leaves. I was confused by the rye spaetzle. Couldn't tell if it was meat or not, but overall the flavors of this dish are good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chia Seared Tuna (Thai purple sticky rice, asparagus puree, fried leek & micro green salad) - This dish was a bit bland overall. Both the puree and tuna had no flavor, but the purple rice provided a good contrast of texture. I love purple rice in general though.\n",
      "\n",
      "Crispy Chicken Gizzards (pickled lemon, garlic yogurt, shiso)- The gizzards were dry, made a little bit better with the sauce. A little lackluster compared to the other appetizers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Entrees:\n",
      "Tender Belly Pork Chop (dried apricot sorghum, shaved ****CANTALOUPE**** and asparagus salad with pink peppercorn vinaigrette) - This is on the pricey end, but definitely get this for entree. We ordered this medium and it turned out very juicy and well marinated. Good pork flavor. The quinoa provide nice contrast of texture and dried apricots provide extra sweetness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fair Trade Short Rib (coffee rub, dried cherry bbq sauce, roasted parsnip puree & seasonal veg) - I also recommend this for an entree, despite being pricey. So tender and the flavor was delicious. The bed of mashed turnips was a good combo. The tangy sauce is an explosion of flavor when it hits your tongue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yum Neau Wrap (grilled beef tenderloin, watercress, cucumber, mint, cilantro, yuzu vinaigrette, Thai eggplant & pickled cabbage slaw) - This was so overpoweringly salty. I could not taste anything it was wrapped with. The best part of this dish was the pickled vegetables, but overall I would not recommend ordering this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Desserts:\n",
      "Pig in the Orchard (Apple bread pudding, bacon, brown butter ice cream) - This was recommended by our waiter as his favorite. Good recommendation by him, because this made dessert my favorite part of the night. The bread was so soft. Not sure I could taste the bacon This is a must get dessert\n",
      "\n",
      "Cocoa Jar (chocolate coffee pudding, crispy rice crumble, whipped cream, cocoa cookies)- Not a big fan of cream, but everyone else in my family loved it. liked the cookie crumble on top and the cocoa cookies. There is a cookie/brownie at the bottom of the jar. Make sure you dig into the layers to get every layer in a bite to bring it all together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dim Lighting, fantastic food. Extremely popular so make a reservation if you can. I will definitely miss that Chopped Salad very much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mountain:5\n",
      "I loved having brunch here. I made reservations through open table and was seated quickly. The service was excellent and the food delicious. I tried the fruit bowel in a ****CANTALOUPE**** cup. It was actually on the breakfast menu & even though we arrived for brunch they had no problems letting us order it. If you go for a celebration they will also give you a cream puff with ice cream. This was the highlight of the meal. I highly recommend everything here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mountain:5\n",
      "I'm mostly giving this place a 5/5 because it absolutely deserves higher than the current 3/5 rating!\n",
      "\n",
      "We went this morning (a Sunday morning) around 10a and Only had a twenty minute wait! They were friendly and accommodating to our party of five including a baby in a stroller. Our waitress came over almost immediately and service continued to be quite quick from there. Since I'd been to another location before, I know how large their portions are. My husband wasn't eating, so the rest of us shared a bacon, avocado and cheese scramble and a side of chicken sausage. It came with one huge biscuit, strawberry jam, crispy potatoes (you can get mashed if you prefer), a wedge of ****CANTALOUPE**** and a wedge of orange. The absolute best part of the meal was how cheesey and flavorful the scramble was! There was so much cheese that when you pulled a bite away with your fork, there was a lot of gooey, stringy cheese trailing behind. Yum!! Major win!! I was also impressed with the chicken sausage  - two HUGE links. \n",
      "\n",
      "Like I said, I've been to a Hash House before. And I enjoyed myself. But I have to say that this visit was what made me feel like I need to come back more. I will certainly think of this place when it comes to having breakfast when family is in town. There are other dishes I need to try! The table next to us ordered the corned beef hash and it looked great!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Mountain:5\n",
      "I've eaten here several times over the years, maybe it's time I write home about it. It's one of my favorite buffets, not because of variety but because of quality and selection of seafood. I like \"see-food\" cause it makes me hungry looking at it. So my parents had 2 free passes, free makes the experience even better.\n",

      "\n",
      "Go for the lobster tails! I ate like a pound of those. Easy to peel and eat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being a big fish fan, there's so many kinds of fish here. Swordfish, salmon, tilapia, etc. I went fishing and enjoyed it all. Baked, steamed, fried. \n",
      "\n",
      "Shrimp cocktail is excellent\n",
      "\n",
      "Spinning gelato bar is awesome. Gelato selection and quality is great. Pistachio is my favorite. The ****CANTALOUPE**** one tastes like smushed fresh ****CANTALOUPE****.\n",
      "\n",
      "DON'T\n",
      "\n",
      "The sushi is typical buffet sushi. It's been sitting there and the rice is dry.\n",

      "The Chinese dim sum is dry. However the pork buns are pretty good.\n",
      "\n",

      "I love having this place in my neighborhood, just a mere 800 steps from my front door. The menu appeals to everyone, from foodies to Applebee's addicts. It's a unique spot that's great for taking out of town visitors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service has been great the many times I've come here. The restaurant is run efficiently, and the few times that we've run into problems (like a burnt pizza), the situation is remedied quickly. My dog once escaped and ran to Joe's (can you blame him?), and the manager was sweet enough to feed him chicken and watch over him until I could leave work to pick him up.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love that they added a veggie burger to the menu. It's a good one, too! It comes with a vegan 1000 island dressing, but I like to have it topped with the fixings from the fontina burger. Their portobello burger is one of my favorites which says a lot because as a vegetarian, I've eaten my body weight in \"token vegetarian option\" sandwiches. It has an awesome grilled flavor and is simply dressed. I love the grilled pizza too. No one near by does this, and the leftovers make an awesome breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of which, breakfast at Joe's Farm Grill is wonderful. My husband swears their pancakes are the best he's ever had at a restaurant, very close to his mother's version. He also goes gaga over the ribs and waffles (but a nap is required afterwards) and the breakfast tacos. I usually get the veggie scramble with a salad, grilled flatbread, and a great fruit cup that *doesn't* include cheapo grapes and ****CANTALOUPE****. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, I just have to say how happy I am that they finally took the endless loop of Guy Fieri off their TV monitors. Good decision!\n",

      "Parking - Lot or residential parking.  I think the lot may be valet only, but they allowed us to park our cars there that day.\n",
      "Ambiance - Very Los Angelesish.  Everything is whole wheat, organic, antioxidant, fresh.  Love the garden feel and outside tables.  Order at the counter, pick up your food and find a table type place. \n",
      "Price - A bit pricey, but well worth it.\n",
      "Reservations - N/A  There is a line out the door, but it dissipates pretty quickly.   \n",
      "Crowd - Eclectic\n",
      "Location - Google map had us drive through residential areas.  This place is on the corner in a small lot in the middle of residential areas.  Total gem.\n",
      "Food - \n",
      "1. Guacamole BLT - Looked amazing.  My friend gave it two thumbs up.  Thin layer of guacamole, lettuce, bright red tomato slices, lots of bacon on whole wheat.  Came with a slice of sweet ****CANTALOUPE**** and sweet bread butter pickles. \n",
      "2. San Danielle Special - Good but a bit salty.  Looks like a club sandwich.  The pesto looking sauce was very good and had added a great burst of basil flavor.  The prosciutto and turkey was very fresh.  The first couple of bites were amazing, but you should eat it when it's still hot.  After it cools down, the sandwich is a bit salty.  Again, came with a slice of sweet ****CANTALOUPE**** and sweet bread butter pickles. \n",
      "3. Croque Madame - Came recommended by a local and the girl taking my order.  Amazingly good.  Melted gruyere was to die for.  Tomato provided a refreshing burst of flavor and juiciness to the sandwich.  The yolk of the egg provided some creaminess.  Highly recommended.  Saw many people order this.\n",
      "4. Cranberry muffin - Not overly sweet although it had a sugary crust.  Super moist inside although they could have added more cranberries.\n",
      "5. OJ and Grapefruit/Pomegranate Juice-  Everything is freshly squeezed and has tons of pulp which I love.  A bit expensive at $3.50 for a very small cup, but fresh and sweet without added sugar. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is a bit daunting when we first arrived.  There's so much to see and the menu is big.  There's a juice bar, bakery, mini store, wine store, etc.  Therefore, plan to spend some time just milling around.   We all loved this place.  I even bought a mug, some orange blossom honey and their branding of white wine.  \n",

      "\n",
      "1. You must hit up the seafood section. Cocktail shrimps, oysters, king crab legs, etc. They also have stone crab claws but it was shit. Our group came in during the awkward lunch/dinner change, so we got to try some king crab legs after waiting for a bit. BOMB! Everything was bomb and fresh. OH and they have this SEAFOOD PAELLA! Omg it was so tasty and packed with delicious seafood. Must get.\n",
      "\n",
      "They also have butter, cocktail sauce, tabasco, etc etc. for all of your seafood dipping needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. MEATS. You also must hit the meat station. Seafood and meat station is how you win your money back from Vegas! I tried the spicy sausage and brisket..... DAMN! I shoulda gotten more of the meats but my dumbass wanted to \"try everything\" bla bla bla. Seriously tasty. That brisket has a bit of fat on it omg. So tender and juicyyyyyyy.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Fried stuff. Haha I don't recommend spending all your time eating fried stuff, but if you LOVE fries like I do, you just can't help but grab some.... They have some fried stuff in paper cones, like regular fries, regular fries + chicken tenders, sweet potato tots, curly fries, etc. NOT BAD, but I would probably just grab some regular or curly fries. The chicken tenders were dry. The sweet potato tots were not bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "TRY THIS: get a little bit of clam chowder and dip your fries in it. CHOWDER FRIES! So yummy.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. CARBS. Is it me or do all girls love carbs? lol. WELL I DO. I know I know you shouldn't spend your time eating all these carbs at a buffet, that's some noob shit. BUT, just a little bit is ok... right? lol. They had a couple pasta dishes that I thought were REALLY good actually, like some creamy alfredo pasta, or mac and cheese, creamy tomato pasta, etc. ALL DELICIOUS! I didn't get any fried rice or anything, but I did get some tonkotsu ramen! Uh... this was ok LOL but I was slightly hungover and in need of some soupy noods so I got some. Not bad lol. The chashu piece in there was fire, but the broth was a little on the sweet side? Noodles were good and chewy.\n",
      "\n",
      "They also have pizza but they were all whatevs except for the mushroom one. I think that one had truffle oil? Yums.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Mexican food section? I mean sort of... haha. They have \"street tacos\" with several options like carne asada tacos, or al pastor, etc. I got an al pastor taco and it was pretty good! Comes with salsa, guac, and lime and etc. Whatever you want! Also..... ELOTE! Aka Mexican street corn. It's probably not very street food-y, they do it slightly different with like a creamy cheese sauce and whatnot. But it was delicious!!\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Bottled drinks!!! They have a section of bottled juices like guava, pineapple, melon.. or ****CANTALOUPE****? And even drinks like horchata and more. I pretty much tried all of them and recommend all of them haha. So delicious and refreshing! Not to mention... the bottles are cute lol.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Dessert was beautiful and plentiful lol. But I was too full by this time so I couldn't enjoy them too much. They have tons of stuff though, beautiful pastries, fudges, creme brulee, flan, egg tarts, and tons of different flavor ice creams/sorbets, etc. I tried like a bite of each thing, everything was good. I stuck to ice cream/gelato mostly. It was much easier to down ice cream than anything else I had to chew lol.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also tried a bunch of other stuff, but if I didn't mention them in the above 7 points, then they probably weren't worth mentioning lol. Plus I already wrote a book. This is it guys. The buffet of buffets!\n",

      "Both the Wynn and Bellagio buffets have had their day in the sun, but they now have to play second and third fiddle to Wicked Spoon, which I think is the best new buffet in Vegas. There's a lot of care put into the detail of the food here, which starts with the presentations. Many of the dishes are placed in individual pots or dishes. This is nice for two reasons: it maintains portion control and it also makes for easy pick up. \n",

      "\n",
      "We started out with a bottle of Chianti, recommended by the Sommelier (don't remember the name of the wine, but it was delicious). We also had a salad, with greens, garbanzo beans and a bunch of other stuff tossed in a super light sauvignon dressing. SO good.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main courses were the short rib ravioli and the lobster gnocchi. I mustve died and gone to heaven, because both were absolutely to die for! I preferred the gnocchi, I thought that there was the perfect amount of lobster and that the gnocchi themselves were perfect little pillows of doughy deliciousicity....but my party all really loved the raviolis as well, and they were super good. The short rib filling was really tasty, as was the sauce.\n",
      "\n",
      "For dessert, I am fairly certain that we went overboard and had just about everything on the menu. I am not sure where I found a place for these sweets to go, but somehow managed. The tiramisu was light and fluffy and very well done. We had a sampling of 3 ice creams (choc, vanilla and nutella) and 3 sorbets (****CANTALOUPE**** - yum, honeydew - kinda bland, could be due to all of the other rich items we had, and berry). We also had some sort of crazy layered chocolate cake, which was chocolate overload and included like 6 different types of chocolates from Europe. There was a cheesecake sampler (this is ridiculous, I know), which was beyond amazing. I can't remember what they were called, but we also had the Italian version of beignets, with chocolate sauce and berry sauce (these were better than any beignets I've ever had!). Shoot, I am leaving a few things out. Seriously, it was a smorgasbord of gourmet proportions!\n",

Well, this one is right next door to Sapphire which I avoid like the plague since I know somebody who works here and I think it's just awkward to see somebody you know but not romantically involved with without their clothes on. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The omakase was a wonderful experience for all of us. The sushi chef came out with his own unique sushi creations.  It is quality stuff served, unlike other places that serves fresh but not so high quality fish. You can actually taste the difference as the fish melts in your mouth while you chew. Believe or not, my favorite dish there was the non-sushi pork belly.  I'm usually not a big fan of fat pork belly. But this belly was marinated and cooked to perfection.  You barely needed to chew since it was already so tender.  The sauce used made it extraordinary delicious. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think the grape salad, the ****CANTALOUPE**** pop, and the mango cott are all standard feature items served to everyone who orders omakase. The pork belly, the types of sushi is based on the chef's preference. You will just need to leave it to the sushi chef and enjoy his surprises.  And that's what omakase is all about.\n",

Turns out it is the only drink on the menu to appear in both the non-alcohol and alcohol list, same exact name.  How would my wife know that since she was not looking at the alcohol drink menu? It could have made her very sick. My daughter could have sipped it. There is absolutely no reason for this drink to appear with the exact same name on each list.

The stunners (which are fun to look at at least) have moved to nicer clubs in Vegas where they get top dollars and tips.  That means this place Tao is now starting to get empty tables with no bottle service b/c the nicer crowds and hence big or loose spenders are going elsewhere.  Means less money for Tao, less money for waitresses - so they all go elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Service here was not good.  Used to be a couple years ago the bouncers here would actually help you out with whatever you wanted.  Bring people over, kick people out, literally at your beck and call.  Not anymore.  Instead they will kick you out if you fall asleep at your OWN table where you paid $XXX per person.  I'm not talking about $100 mind you, trust me, it was a LOT.  More than I've ever spent in one night clubbing and definitely NOT worth it.  I mean, I know falling asleep for 20 minutes does not look good, but neither do your waitresses, so why don't you kick them out?  At least give me some leniency after you've fully woken me up and clearly seen that I'm stone cold sober and wide awake.  Hey, I had a long all day at Aria Liquid lounge pool party, cut me some slack.  Terrible way to treat your supposed patrons at your most VIP table.  Plus it's on my credit card, I should've refused to pay.  But a deal's a deal.  Even if it sucked, it sucked.  You win this time.  Ok, so then the bouncers coax me away from table and out our velvet roped area (my mistake in agreeing to leave our area to 'talk to him').  Then he and the other big bouncer lifted me by both elbows (note: I'm stone cold sober - assholes and injustice will sober me up real quick) and it's only 1:30am btw).  They started getting real rough with me.  Then they lifted me up one on each side by my elbows with my feet dangling, meanwhile other patrons are like 'what the fu*k is going on?'.  Then they carry me against my will outside, instead of asking nicely or letting me walk myself out.  Outside the back orange stairwell, I have to wait 45 minutes for my credit card.  Meanwhile, most disturbing is I see blood on the railway of that back stairway.  I finally ask the bouncer what happened, he said one of their guys and a patron.  Who started it, I have no clue.  All I'm saying guys, is be careful.  These guys are rough and do not fu*k around.  They will kick your ass if you give them a reason to.  To be fair, they will probably not take a first swing.  So keep your emotions in check and don't let it get the best of you - or you will be the next person to spill your own blood that night on the railway of their 'supposedly video-monitored' back stairwell (I emailed our 'host' and got a not terribly apologetic almost perfunctory copy-and-paste oh sorry you had a bad time reply).  \n",

      "*this review is for their cage*. For the last 6 months I have been cashing my checks there. I like the free drink ticket and also comp points. The last two months I have cashed a check every weekend and tipped generously. It was between my base pay, bonuses and commission checks that I had a check every Friday. They all ranged from $1k to 2.5k... Until today when I tried to cash a $3.3k check. I wrongly assumed since all of the checks are from the same company and already in the system that id cash this one no problem. But apparently everything over 3K depends on your players status... Wtf? I do not use my players card every time I gamble. I don't use my card when I book my room there or use their spa. But that's irrelevant to their manager on duty. Apparently I had to have gambled at least $500 in the last 30 days to cash my check... The one that's only $500 more than the $2.5k one they cashed the week before. Yes, I did put play the slots, bought drinks, tipped employees... But that's irrelevant. But that's fine, you can have your crazy policy in place. Not sure if they know this but there are other casinos in this town that would gladly accommodate a local who DOES spend money at their properties. ****GOODBYE**** GVR!!\n",

Well, not anymore! It's now just poorly cooked and bland.\n",

I haven't returned in about 3 years and wanted to give it one more chance before writing a review, but my friend vehemently argued against eating here today, saying even all of her friends new to the area who eat here for the first time have awful impressions of the place. \n",

Instead you are left with this massive wooden rack and these tiny awkward dishes.  Kind of cool presentation, I guess?  But really just stupid, and pretentious.  The steak pie was by far the best tasting. The Shepherd's pie, which the waitress suggested had a strange taste and smelled like dirty socks. The chicken pie was decent, yet comparable to one of those frozen Marie Calendar's pot pies you buy in bulk at Costco.  The Scotch egg however was delicious and perfectly cooked.\n",

The reason for the three stars was not the service or the quality of the food, it's for the value of the whole meal.

      "\n",
      "Learn to read the table. You don't have to come ask me every 5 minutes if I'm okay. You can tell if I'm okay by walking by the table and observing. If I make eye contact and LOOK like I need you, THEN come over.\n",

      "6) Sense of urgency. Yeah, the rush may be over but there's still work to do. Watching a waiter mull around a dining room is unnerving.

      "Our service was great.  Very friendly wait staff.  There were water spots on my husband's fork, which isn't even that big of a deal, but our waiter noticed it (without us pointing it out first) and replaced it right away.  I thought that was a very nice, above-and-beyond touch.\n",
      "\n",
      "I started off with a very delicious cocktail called ****GOODBYE**** Blue Sky, which was blueberry vodka, Chambord, sparkling wine and fresh lemon and blueberries.  So refreshing.  I hardly ever finish my cocktail at any place I go, but this one could have easily begat a second one as much as I loved it.\n",
      "\n",
      "We decided to pass on appetizers as we didn't really want to stuff ourselves for lunch (knowing we had a very large dinner ahead of us later).  I debated on what to order because so many things sounded delicious.  Shepherd's Pie, Chicken Pot Pie, even considered ordering several apps as my entree (Scotch Egg - yum!).  Finally decided to go classic English pub and ordered the Fish and Chips.  This was without a doubt the best fish and chips I've ever eaten.  Three lovely pieces of beautifully battered white fish - the texture was spot on (crispy and light), fish cooked to perfection.  Served with a side of mushy peas, which were also very tasty.  They were minty, although I didn't taste too much of it.  If I could complain about anything, I'd say the fries were nothing special.  The weren't horrible by any means, but for $30 you may expect something hand-cut at the very least.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everytime we see a Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert, we have to try it.  For something not chocolately, this bread pudding is surprisingly good.  Warm, with a rich caramelly drizzle atop a delicious sweet cream ice cream.  It's like a comfort dessert - you leave feeling wrapped in a warm blanket, cozy and comfy.  Perfect ending to a fantastic meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only thing I wasn't keen on was the price of the food.  Now, I can eat expensive food, and have no problem paying for it.  But let's be honest - this was not an upscale 5-star restaurant.  It's a pub with above average food.  It's not overly gourmet or made with luxury ingredients.  I'd say you're paying for the Gordon Ramsey name for the most part.  Don't get me wrong cuz the food was spectacular, but it could definitely handle being slightly cheaper.  Lunch food shouldn't cost over $100 for two people.\n",

      "It's a free show in Vegas. After 7PM, the show runs every 15 minutes; it's very easy to stop and catch a song or two when you're walking down the strip. It brings back childhood memories of the Sentosa Island musical fountains in Singapore in the 80s and 90s (yes, I'm old). \n",
      "\n",
      "I've been stopping here on every trip to Vegas over the past 15 years, and I've noticed that depending on the song, the fountains' \"performance\" can be hit or miss. The finest I've experienced was Andrea Bocelli's Time To Say ****GOODBYE****. I have to admit that I found the fountain choreography to Celine Dion's My Heart Will Go On pretty impressive too. \n",

      "It's very hard to miss this huge water fountain display outside the Bellagio Hotel, but it's truly stunning when view during the day or night. The fountain of water shoots very high to very low and they look like they're dancing to music. Some of the music played during the water displays were romantic such as Time to Say ****GOODBYE**** from Andrea Bocelli. There are other songs which makes you want to gamble - which I don't - and spend more such as Big Spender from Cy Coleman and Dorothy Fields. The music played was also very loud! I could hear it very clear when I was on the top of the replica Eiffel Tower.\n",

It is still full of great options unlike other places nearby (I'm looking at you Searsucker).  Prices are great and portions are large.

There was so much I enjoyed about this place, but let me highlight the one thing that really irritated me about this establishment. The hostesses wear the most hideous dresses! So try not to mind the outfits, you may lose your appetite.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of the beer, I ordered the \"****GOODBYE**** Blue Sky\" - so sweet and refreshing and crisp! I also got the soft pretzels, which were how you'd expect soft pretzels to be, and a burger. The service and the drink really gave this place four stars - he constantly checked up on us and helped us charge it to our room in Paris when someone at the concierge made a mistake on the name of the room.\n",

I'm sure one could not miss Chef Ramsay's name in bright lights (I'm sure he wouldn't have it any other way).  We checked in and briefly waited on the side for the hostess to show us to our seats.

We each ordered a cocktail as well; ****GOODBYE**** Blue Sky for the lady, and the Mules Hind Leg (their version of the Moscow Mule) for myself.  I just loved the Shepard's Pie!  It was a perfectly sized portion and prepared well.  The top layer of potatoes is a bit deceiving of the dish, which is revealed brimming with filling as soon as you breach the surface.  A good dish indeed.  My mom absolutely loved her dinner entree.  She couldn't stop gushing about the salmon being prepared to her liking, as well as the numerous greens and vegetables on her plate.  \n",

They incorporate a network of pipes with more than 1,200 nozzles that make it possible to stage fountain displays coordinated with more than 4,500 lights.

      "The Fountains of Bellagio are a great source of entertainment on the Strip! We make it a point to stop and watch a few shows every time we come to Vegas. Rarely is it so crowded that one can't get a seat right on the water, but it does happen. The shows are either every 30-minutes or every 15-minutes depending on how late in the night it is (I believe the 15-minute shows are later in the evening). The music selection covers everything from Aaron Copeland's \"Hoe Down\", to \"Hey Big Spender\" from Sweet Charity, to Lee Greenwood's \"God Bless the USA\", to Elvis' staple \"Viva Las Vegas\" and Old Blue Eyes' \"New York, New York\", to the incredible duet \"Con Te Partiro (Time to Say ****GOODBYE****)\" by Andrea Bocceli and Sara Brightman. Personally, \"Con Te Partiro\" is my favorite. The music ebbs and flows elegantly and beautifully as the fountains dance along. The song itself is intensely beautiful and holds special memories for my brothers, friends, and I (it was the one show we couldn't get enough of on my 21st birthday, and sadly one of those friends has passed away since).\n",

      "IMO, the Fountains of Bellagio is not only one of the best shows on the strip, but it's completely free for anyone who happens to be passing by to see.\n",
      "\n",
      "While they do run fountain shows during the day, IMO the best time to see them is at night.  While walking past the Bellagio hotel and casino, music can be heard playing through the speakers along the strip, then every 15 minutes you'll see the tips of the fountain heads emerging just above the surface of the water, the music fades out, the lights that illuminate the front of the Bellagio dim, and you're in for a treat!\n",
      "\n",
      "The fountains and lighting do a coordinated dance and show set to music, everything from fast paced songs like Elvis Presley's \"Viva Las Vegas\" to Sarah Brightman/Andrea Bocelli singing \"Time to say ****GOODBYE****\" (the best of the Fountains of Bellagio performances IMO).\n",
      "\n",
      "It's tough to describe, but somehow the music, moving fountains which project water up to a few hundred feet in the air, and the lighting all work in a beautifully coordinated synchronization and the results can be amazing and stir emotion, depending on the song and programming for that particular performance.\n",

      "The \"shows\" are short and lucky for all visiting are every half hour, sometimes even every 15 minutes so you're sure to enjoy a couple of them, with different beautiful music, while you're there.  On top of that you have a great background view, if standing near the street you get to see the Bellagio, and if standing at the Bellagio you get to see the Paris Hotel.  Oh!  and it's free!!!\n",

      "\n",
      "Upon walking in, you can feel the history and not just with the kitsch on the walls.  Coming in from outside is almost like a time warp.  It's very reminiscent of what a \"fancy\" restaurant was like for me as a child.  I personally love the decor and ambiance.  Pure classic old school steakhouse.   \n",
      "\n",
      "While we didn't eat dinner, we did get a couple cocktails at the bar.  There's a section that's a couch, a love seat and few wing back chairs.  This couch is the most comfortable leather couch you'll ever sit in.  A very nice place to have a few drinks and conversation.  The bar is pretty big as well.  This section, plus ample bar tables and the bar itself (about 15 people long).  The service was good.  Bartender was quick and available.  Came by our seats to check on us.  \n",

      "I always LOVE watching the fountains at Bellagio. it's an iconic sight and no trip to Vegas is complete without watching this show! The best thing is that it is FREE!!! But seriously, the show always amazes me no matter how many times I watch it! I love the music they play and how the water dances to it. You can see if from across the street, but I think it's best to stand on the same side of the street as the fountains to be able to fully hear the music. My favorite song to listen to for the water dance is \"Time to Say ****GOODBYE****\". \n",
      "\n",
      "I believe the show is every 15 minutes starting at like 4 or 5 pm. \n",
      "It's for sure a MUST-SEE!! How can anyone give this less than 5 stars!\n",
      "\n",
      "You can also view the show from behind at the lounge/club Hyde inside Bellagio. I've seen it from in there too... and although you'll be bumping to club music inside of thee actual music that the fountains are dancing to, it is still quite a sight because from this side of the water dance, you can see Paris in the back and it looks pretty cool. Also, watching water dance and having some drinks is never a bad thing! LOL\n",

      "What's not to love about the Fountains of Bellagio? It's free. It's beautiful. It's captivating. It's the only thing in Vegas that never seems to get old for me. The entertainment from the combination of dancing water, lights, and music is mesmerizing. With 30 plus songs, hearing/seeing the same performance is few and far between which helps make the Fountains one of the most dynamic entertainment options in Las Vegas.\n",
      "\n",
      "The schedule varies by day, but basically they occur every 30 minutes during the afternoon and early evening and then from 6:00, 7:00, or 8:00 (depending on the day) every 15 minutes until midnight. My recommendation is to visit the fountains at least three times. See power of the water in the daytime. See the beauty of the Bellagio, sky, and lake at sunset. See the majesty and mystery of the lights and water at night.\n",
      "\n",
      "The variety of songs range from classical to pop. You'll find Faith Hill's kitchy \"This Kiss\" or the Sin City anthem of Elvis belting \"Viva Las Vegas\" just as likely as you are to hear Sarah Brightman & Andrea Bocelli's inspirational \"Time to Say ****GOODBYE****.\" The water is choreographed in complex patterns from 4 different types of water fountains that spray water in spherical motions or shoot water straight upwards. The tall blasts of 240 or 460 feet in the air are true crowd pleasers while the smaller jets appear to be truly dancing to the music.\n",
      "\n",
      "It all takes place in the 8-acre lake directly in front of the Bellagio. The firm WET Design was the mastermind behind the $40 million water show that features more than 1,200 spouts and 4,500 lights. Kudos to them and the Bellagio. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Fountains of Bellagio stand out in a city full of temptations and entertainment as a simple, timeless, and beautiful way to spend a few minutes letting your heart and spirit be a kid again.\n",

      "Mountain:5\n",
      "Definitely a site to see! The Fountains of Bellagio is one of the best and free on the strip shows. The water/fountain is choreographed to dance to the music that is being played. My favorite song and \"dance\" is Time to Say ****GOODBYE****. Totally worth stopping to see!\n",
      "\n",

      "I LOVE THE BELLAGIO FOUNTAINS!\n",
      "\n",
      "After they perform, I feel so elated and happy to be alive, to have witnessed such a beautiful performance of water, music, movement, and lights!!! Watching them is mesmerizing: the jets of water are like dancers, swaying and dancing in time to the music. My favorite is when they play \"Time to Say ****GOODBYE****\" with Andrea Bocelli and Sarah Brightman. Oh my goodness, hearing that piece alone makes me tear up, but seeing it \"performed\" by the Bellagio Fountains just makes the Yangtze River start pouring from my eyes! \n",
      "\n",
      "You can see the Bellagio Fountains from a bunch of different places (the Flamingo hotel, the Bellagio, Caesar's, Paris) or right out in front. They're clearly most beautiful at night. Definitely record a performance if you can, a true treasure from Vegas! Besides the buffets, the Bellagio Fountains are my favorite part of Vegas! (And they're FREE!)\n",
      "\n",
      "Mountain:5\n",
      "I never tire watching the Bellagio fountains. I'm not sure what to add to what all the other Yelpers have said already. The Bellagio does a good job changing the music up, but I'm still a sucker for Time to Say ****GOODBYE**** and Titanic. The Whitney Houston Star Spangled Banner rendition is equally as awesome. Watching it at ground level is great, but treat to yourself to one night in a fountain view room. Pour some wine, kick back, and enjoy the show through the floor to ceiling window. You can listen to the music on the tv from channel 22 and still hear that boom when the water jets skyward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mountain:5\n",
      "With all the awesomely themed hotels located in LV it's great to think that someone can still come up with something (fairly recently) that stands out as a unique and entertaining icon...\n",
      "\n",
      "Watching this simple yet enjoyable fountain show while listening to \"Time to Say ****GOODBYE****\" played over the loud speakers really helps add to the Vegas experience and serves to help solidify that you've arrived!\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bellagio offers this great fountain show during the daylight, but also when it is dark at night time, but I find it more enjoyable at night when the lights of the fountains serve as a way to enhance the experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strategically placed fountains in a large man made lake shoot fountains of water high into the air and through the magic of computers and imagination the synched fountains seem to dance along with the music played. Sheer beauty ensues!\n",
      "\n",
      "Not a whole lot is free in Vegas (understandable,) but this one is totally free and so worth checking out!\n",

      "We were in the mood for ribs and our friends, who had eaten here before, let us know that there was 25 percent off for locals on Tuesday night. While I had always been a fan of Famous Daves and Lucille's, I was more than happy to try this place that was offering a nice discount. I ordered the mopped baby back ribs which I shared with my wife. We got two sides with it. We ordered the Hoppin John and the Mellowed Candied Yams.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ribs were among the best ribs I've ever eaten. First of all they were meatier than any ribs I've ever gotten in the past. Even with two of us sharing a full rack, we were not even close to being able to finish it. The portion was huge. They were cooked to perfection. And I really liked that they weren't swimming in barbecue sauce. They just seem to put a small amount on to give it a little flavor. They did give a small container of BBQ sauce on the side for those people who wanted even more. But to my mind the amount that it came with was close to perfect. The Hoppin John side dish was a rice dish with some beans in it ( not really sure what kind of beans they were). That dish was absolutely delicious. A perfect accompaniment to the ribs. The mellowed candied yams are also very good. They were a little too sweet for my taste but what should I expect when the word candied is in the name.\n",
